" (CNN)Could France elect Barack Obama president? Not really -- but that's not stopping the organizers of Obama17, a guerrilla campaign trying to entice the former U.S. president to head to Paris. ""It's totally crazy, but the cool thing is that once you get past that, you start thinking that maybe it's possible. Who cares that he's not French? He's Barack Obama,"" one of the campaign organizers told CNN. They've launched a website and they put up 500 posters of Obama around Paris last weekend, said the organizer. He asked to be identified only as Antoine. They're hoping to get 1 million people to sign a petition urging Obama to run.  Yes, it's a joke, he admits -- but one with a serious purpose. ""We want to show that people are fed up with the politicians here. People are tired about it and they like this joke. It gives people a little fun amid all these scandals,"" he said.

Someone to vote for, not against Polls suggest that Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front party, will top the field in the first round, but won't get the absolute majority a candidate needs to win outright.  Antoine isn't a fan of the frontrunner. ""We are so fed up with what Marine Le Pen is doing, and with the fact that we weren't able to find a candidate to vote for, only one to vote against,"" said Antoine. ""We started talking about that and it came up that Obama is free -- so why not hire him?"" Antoine knows there's not much chance Obama will play along with his joke. But he says people have been getting in touch with serious suggestions -- for example, how to get around the problem that Obama isn't French. ""We've had some funny emails from lawyers telling us how it could be possible. He would have to be naturalized by the president of the French Assembly,"" Antoine said. It's not clear whether Obama is aware of the project, but Antoine is hopeful. ""I think if Barack Obama answers this, there will be a huge amount of reaction. I think he might like this kind of thing,"" said Antoine. ""People in France would get crazy, especially young people. But he won't say yes to our proposal."" "
"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump Tuesday signed a measure nixing a regulation aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of some severely mentally ill people.  The original rule was part of a series of efforts taken by the Obama administration to try and curb gun violence after other efforts failed to advance in Congress. Using the Congressional Review Act -- which allows Congress to roll back regulations imposed by the executive branch -- the Republican-controlled House and Senate voted to send the bill to Trump's desk.   What was the rule? The regulation, finalized in December under Obama's tenure, required the Social Security Administration to disclose information quarterly to the national gun background check system about certain people with mental illness.   While the list of eligible mental disorders is long -- ranging from anxiety to eating disorders to schizophrenia --those who would have been reported by the agency had to meet two main criteria: a) They were receiving full disability benefits because of a mental illness and couldn't work and b) they were unable to manage their own benefits, thus needing the help of a third party to do so.   The Obama administration estimated that the new rule would have affected roughly 75,000 individuals annually.   And according to a report by the Office of the Inspector General at the Social Security Administration, 81,000 disability awardees would have met the criteria in fiscal year 2015, which amounts to about 9% of the total disability awardee population.   Those affected would have been notified both orally and in writing that they could potentially be prevented from buying a gun.  Such individuals would have been allowed to request a relief from any firearm prohibitions if they could show evidence that they didn't pose a risk to public safety.  While the rule wasn't effective until January 18, compliance was not required until later this year -- in December. So it's unlikely that anyone has been affected by the rule. Who opposed the rule? Interestingly, the rule had opponents across a wide spectrum. Both the National Rifle Association and the American Civil Liberties Union spoke out against it.   The ACLU, which advocates for people with mental health struggles, said the rule reinforced a stereotype that people with mental disabilities are violent. The organization argued in a letter to members of Congress that there's no data to support a connection between receiving disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence.  Susan Mizner, senior attorney with the disability rights program at the ACLU, also said that people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims of violence.   While proponents of the rule argue that it only affects a limited group, opponents say that it unfairly targets the wrong people.   ""75,000 people a year is a lot of people in my book,"" Mizner said. ""And these are people who are already at the bottom of our social status. We don't need to kick them anymore."" Who supported it? Gun control groups and activists supported the rule because they felt it would prevent some suicides and accidental deaths. They argued that it helped enforced laws already in the books that require mental health reporting by federal agencies, said Lindsay Nichols, senior attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""The American people and the families that are being hurt day after day by gun violence -- they deserve some due process too,"" said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas.  "
" (CNN)Andrew Jackson may be giving way to Harriet Tubman on the face of the $20 bill, but the seventh president's image is on the ascent in the modern White House. On his fifth day in office, President Donald Trump elevated a portrait of his distant predecessor to a place in the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump flew south to Nashville, Tennessee, where he visited the Hermitage, Jackson's home, and placed a wreath at his tomb. ""It was during the revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite -- does that sound familiar to you?"" Trump said to cheers. ""I wonder why they keep talking about Trump and Jackson, and Jackson and Trump."" His next destination hinted at an explanation. After brief remarks, Trump rolled over to the Music City's Municipal Auditorium for a rally with supporters. It's an appropriate venue if only for its proximity to Jackson, the first president elected on a populist platform, and one known to have enjoyed the close company of his most spirited backers.  Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor, Steve Bannon, has endorsed and promoted the comparison. In a post-election interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the former Breitbart boss compared his new patron to Old Hickory. ""Like (Andrew) Jackson's populism, we're going to build an entirely new political movement,"" he said. ""It's everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy."" Mostly though, the conservatives have fallen in line. Trump moved toward them as he hammered out his Cabinet. But the fight over health care reform has exposed familiar fissures in the Republican Party. The President is navigating them carefully -- for now, at least.  The Jackson analogies are not entirely off base, but they have their limits. Unlike Trump, Jackson was not born into wealth. And while he made his fortune in due time, he also collected government checks as a military general and during multiple stints in Congress. When Jackson failed in his first run at the presidency, in 1824, he said the game had been rigged against him -- and the facts agreed. Indeed, he won the popular vote. But none of the four candidates that year won an electoral college majority, so the contest went to the House of Representatives and the speaker, Henry Clay, traded his considerable influence for a place as John Quincy Adams' secretary of state.   Of course, to say that Trump differs from Jackson should, in many cases, be a welcome observation. Jackson, both before and during his presidency, had been brutal with the Native American population, then ruthless in driving them from their ancestral homes. A few months after signing the Indian Removal Act in 1830, he addressed his former colleagues.  ""It gives me pleasure,"" he said, ""to announce to Congress that the benevolent policy of the government, steadily pursued for nearly 30 years, in relation to the removal of the Indians beyond the white settlements is approaching to a happy consummation."" As he spoke those words, the Trail of Tears was nearly a decade off, and by 1840, Native communities would, largely by Jackson's policies, be almost entirely wiped out of the American Southeast. It is for that, and his support of slavery, that Jackson ultimately lost his place on the twenty. During the campaign, Trump called the decision, made by President Barack Obama's Treasury Department, ""pure political correctness.""  But the candidate had kind words for Tubman, too. She was, Trump said, ""fantastic."" "

"Washington (CNN)Former President Barack Obama has been named the 2017 ""Profile in Courage"" award honoree by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.  The foundation said Thursday it is recognizing Obama for ""expanding health security for millions of Americans, restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba and leading a landmark international accord to combat climate change.""  The award, created in 1989, is given to a public official or group of public servants from any level of government each year ""whose actions demonstrate the qualities of politically courageous leadership in the spirit of 'Profiles in Courage,' President Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer prize-winning book,"" according to the Profile in Courage award website.  Obama isn't the only president who has been so honored: former Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush have also received the award. ""Our country owes a debt of gratitude to President Obama, not just for the many important policy achievements made during his tenure but also for the example of leadership he provided all of us, which we may draw upon in the years to come,"" Jack Schlossberg, the son of JFK's daughter, Caroline Kennedy, said in a statement. Obama will receive the award during a ceremony in May. "
"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN)President Donald Trump is back to attacking his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. In a series of tweets early Saturday morning, Trump called Obama a ""bad"" or ""sick"" person after accusing him, without evidence, of ordering the government to tap his phones during the 2016 presidential campaign. While attacks from Trump aimed at Obama are nothing we haven't seen before, they come after months of restraint and even complimentary comments Trump has made about his predecessor since he was elected president. And they marked a return to Trump's earlier treatment of Obama. The relationship is all best summed up in a comment Trump made on Fox News in late January: ""What amazed me is that I was vicious to him in statements, he was vicious to me in statements, and here we are getting along, we're riding up Pennsylvania Avenue. ... We don't even mention it. I guess that's the world of politics."" Here's a look back at some of what Trump has had to say about Obama over the years: March 2011 ""I want him to show his birth certificate. ... There's something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like."" -- Trump on ""The View"" on March 23, 2011. Trump launched himself into the national political conversation in March 2011, when he began to publicly question whether Obama was born in the United States -- effectively taking a megaphone to a conspiracy theory that for years had swirled in conservative circles. August 2012 ""An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud,"" he tweeted on August 6, 2012. Trump continued to accuse Obama of not being born in the US for several years after Obama released his birth certificate.  November 2015 ""I think he's a threat to our country,"" Trump said on a radio show. January 2016 ""Obama is one of the worst negotiators on everything I've ever seen except for when it comes to dealing with the Republicans,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC News. March 2016 ""He may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me,"" Trump said at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference. June 2016 ""There's something going on,"" Trump intoned about Obama in a June interview, suggesting Obama was sympathetic to radical Islamist terrorists. ""You know, people cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism,"" he said on Fox News. ""There's something going on — it's inconceivable. There's something going on."" August 2016 ""I think he's the worst president maybe in the history of our country,"" said Trump on Fox News. He also called Obama a ""disaster,"" ""weak"" and ""ineffective"" in the interview, echoing many of his criticisms of Obama on the campaign trail. August, 2016 ""ISIS is honoring President Obama. He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder. He founded ISIS,"" Trump said at an August 10, 2016, campaign rally. November 10, 2016 Obama is a ""good man,"" Trump said in the Oval Office after meeting Obama for first time. ""Really good meeting, great chemistry,"" Trump tweeted after meeting with Obama at the White House. Earlier that day, he told Obama it was a ""great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many, many more times,"" saying he would seek Obama's counsel. December 7, 2016 ""I must tell you, you know, I never met him before this. I never spoke to him before this. I really -- I do like him,"" Trump said in interview about his predecessor. Trump added that he was seeking Obama's advice on appointments and has been taking ""his recommendations very seriously."" December 28, 2016 ""Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!"" Trump tweeted. Later, Trump added: ""I'm getting along very well with him ... other than a couple of statements (that) I responded to and we talked about it and smiled about it."" ""We are never going to be going against each other,"" he added. January 22, 2017 ""I just went to the Oval Office and found this beautiful letter from President Obama. It was really very nice of him to do that. And I will cherish that,"" Trump said. February 6, 2017 ""We get along, I don't know if he'll admit this, but he likes me. I like him,"" Trump said during his Super Bowl interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly.  February 27, 2017 ""I think he is behind it. I also think it is politics, that's the way it is,"" Trump said, accusing Obama of being responsible for protests against Republicans. March 4, 2017 ""Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!"" Trump tweeted, adding, ""Bad (or sick) guy!"" "
"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN)Democrats sharply criticized President Donald Trump's calls on lawmakers Sunday to investigate his baseless claim that former President Barack Obama tapped his phone.  Republicans, meanwhile, urged Trump to let the House and Senate intelligence committees do their jobs.  Both parties made clear that Trump's allegation -- which the White House has not offered any evidence to support, and which Obama administration officials emphatically deny -- won't be dropped anytime soon, as even GOP lawmakers who have backed Trump said they'd investigate.  Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said his committee would look into whether the federal government was conducting wiretapping of campaign officials as part of the panel's investigation into Russian meddling in the US election. ""One of the focus points of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation is the U.S. government's response to actions taken by Russian intelligence agents during the presidential campaign,"" Nunes said in a statement Sunday. ""As such, the Committee will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party's campaign officials or surrogates, and we will continue to investigate this issue if the evidence warrants it."" Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee announced Sunday night they planned to ask White House Counsel Donald McGahn to provide the committee with a list of communications between the White House and the Department of Justice regarding probes into Russian interference in the election. Other Democrats, meanwhile, accused Trump of advancing yet another unfounded conspiracy in an effort to distract from the issues dogging his administration in its early weeks.  ""You make up something and then you have the press write about it, and then you say, 'everybody's writing about this charge,'"" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""It's a tool of an authoritarian, to just have you always be talking about what you want to be talking about."" Their comments come after Trump's aides asked Congress to look into whether the Obama administration abused its investigative powers during the 2016 election. ""Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in the statement, which he also posted on Twitter. ""President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. ""Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted,"" Spicer added. He did not provide any further details on the President's request to Congress. RELATED: Trump's baseless wiretap claim While Spicer said ""reports"" prompted the call for a congressional investigation, the White House still has not provided any evidence to back up the President's accusations. There are no publicly known credible reports to back up Trump's claim that Obama ordered Trump's phones be monitored. Frustrated that the Russia stories have overshadowed a widely praised performance in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, Trump angrily raised the wiretapping issue unprompted in conversations with friends and acquaintances at Mar-a-Lago, two people who have spoken with him at his Palm Beach resort over the last 24 hours said on Sunday. The President didn't specify what information he was basing his accusations upon, but told them he expected an investigation to prove him right. Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy posted a column Sunday saying he spoke with the President twice on Saturday about the wiretap story. ""When I mentioned Obama 'denials' about the wiretaps, he shot back: 'This will be investigated, it will all come out. I will be proven right,"" Ruddy wrote. Multiple former senior US officials have dismissed Trump's allegations, however, calling them ""nonsense"" and ""false."" Obama, through a spokesman, also rejected the claim that he ordered Trump's phones tapped. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, a career intelligence official who had oversight of the US intelligence community in that role, said Sunday that Trump was not wiretapped by intelligence agencies nor did the FBI obtain a court order through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor Trump's phones. ""For the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign,"" Clapper said Sunday morning on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Members of the intelligence committees  House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff called Trump's claims as ""destructive as it was baseless,"" but tied the President's call to the California Democrat's criticism of FBI Director James Comey for not being forthcoming about any investigation of ties between Russia and the Trump administration. ""If the administration truly believes that President Obama illegally eavesdropped on the Trump campaign and wants our committee to investigate the matter, they should join my call on Director Comey to answer any question put to him that is pertinent to the Russia investigation,"" Schiff said in a statement.  The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Richard Burr of North Carolina, said his panel would follow the evidence trail in its investigation of Russian intelligence activities. ""As I've said since the beginning and have repeated since, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence will follow the evidence where it leads, and we will continue to be guided by the intelligence and facts as we compile our findings,"" Burr said. Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted at Spicer that he looks forward ""to seeing your evidence,"" calling the allegations a ""mess."" Himes also mocked Trump's claim in a tweet Sunday. ""BREAKING: HIMES ADMITS TO TAPPING. 'I know this will end up being sticky, but yes, I did the tapping' #maplenotwire"" he tweeted with a picture of him tapping a tree for syrup. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he's ""not sure what it is (Trump) is talking about,"" but added it's possible that ""perhaps the President has information that is not yet available to us or to the public."" Rubio pointed out that the Senate Intelligence Committee is already in the process of reviewing Russia's meddling in the US elections last year and will eventually issue a public report.  ""But what I think we should do is, everybody needs to take a deep breath and calm down here,"" the Florida Republican told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""And let's go through this as what we are doing. In the Senate Intelligence Committee, we are working in a bipartisan way to collect facts that involve reviewing classified and sometimes unclassified and open-source information."" Sen. Susan Collins, also a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday morning that she has ""seen no evidence"" to back up Trump's wiretapping allegation and called on the White House to turn over any evidence to the committee. ""What we need to deal with is evidence, not statements,"" the Maine Republican said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Democratic leaders  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he believes Trump is ""in trouble"" whether there was a court order authorizing surveillance of his phones or ""if he falsely spread this kind of misinformation."" ""If he falsely spread this kind of misinformation, that is so wrong. It's beneath the dignity of the presidency. It is something that really hurts people's view of government,"" the New York Democrat said Sunday on ""Meet the Press."" ""On the other hand, if it's true, it's even worse for the President. Because that means that a federal judge, independently elected, has found probable cause that the president, or people on his staff, have probable cause to have broken the law or to have interacted with a foreign agent. Now that's serious stuff."" RELATED: Graham vows to 'get to the bottom' of Trump's wiretapping claims Schumer said he had no problem with the congressional intelligence committees including Trump's request in their investigation into Russian activity in the 2016 election, but he also used the call as an opportunity to reiterate Democrats' calls for a special prosecutor to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. CNN's Manu Raju, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report."

Rubio pointed out that the Senate Intelligence Committee is already in the process of reviewing Russia's meddling in the US elections last year and will eventually issue a public report.  ""But what I think we should do is, everybody needs to take a deep breath and calm down here,"" the Florida Republican told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""And let's go through this as what we are doing. In the Senate Intelligence Committee, we are working in a bipartisan way to collect facts that involve reviewing classified and sometimes unclassified and open-source information."" Sen. Susan Collins, also a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday morning that she has ""seen no evidence"" to back up Trump's wiretapping allegation and called on the White House to turn over any evidence to the committee. ""What we need to deal with is evidence, not statements,"" the Maine Republican said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Democratic leaders  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he believes Trump is ""in trouble"" whether there was a court order authorizing surveillance of his phones or ""if he falsely spread this kind of misinformation."" ""If he falsely spread this kind of misinformation, that is so wrong. It's beneath the dignity of the presidency. It is something that really hurts people's view of government,"" the New York Democrat said Sunday on ""Meet the Press."" ""On the other hand, if it's true, it's even worse for the President. Because that means that a federal judge, independently elected, has found probable cause that the president, or people on his staff, have probable cause to have broken the law or to have interacted with a foreign agent. Now that's serious stuff."" RELATED: Graham vows to 'get to the bottom' of Trump's wiretapping claims Schumer said he had no problem with the congressional intelligence committees including Trump's request in their investigation into Russian activity in the 2016 election, but he also used the call as an opportunity to reiterate Democrats' calls for a special prosecutor to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama have not spoken since the inauguration, but their respective advisers have. Two people familiar with the matter say Trump's White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and Obama's former White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, have spoken since Trump claimed, without evidence, that Obama had him wiretapped. There have also been conversations between other former Obama officials and Trump officials since Saturday. ""There is a dialogue,"" one person familiar with the conversations said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the talks. The question is whether these talks among advisers will ultimately lead to a conversation between the 44th and 45th presidents. Spokesmen for Trump and Obama declined to comment. Obama was irked and exasperated in response to his successor's uncorroborated  wiretapping accusation, sources close to the former president tell CNN, though these sources say Obama's reaction stopped short of outright fury.  Obama and his aides responded with disbelief when they learned of Trump's Saturday morning tweets laying out the charges. Later in the day, an Obama spokesman said ""neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any US citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false."" The sources provided CNN with slightly different insight into Obama's demeanor than others who told The Wall Street Journal that Obama was ""livid."" Obama's loyal army of supporters have been far more active in voicing their dissatisfaction with Trump. On social media and television, former aides have been aggressively pushing back on Trump in the first weeks of his presidency.  Presidents Trump and Obama have not spoken since Inauguration Day, when Obama welcomed Trump for coffee in the White House and accompanied him to the US Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony. The two men had developed what Trump termed a ""warm"" relationship in the run-up to Trump's inauguration, fostered by an in-person meeting in the Oval Office and several phone conversations. But people close to both men acknowledge that the bitterness of the presidential campaign, paired with Trump's longstanding antagonism toward Obama regarding his birth certificate, would make a close relationship improbable. On the weekend that Trump levied his explosive charges, Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, were spotted at the National Gallery of Art in Washington on a private tour of artist Theaster Gates' new exhibition. The President was all smiles when he departed the museum, dressed casually and carrying a bag from the gallery's gift shop. Asked Monday whether Trump's claims would damage the relationship between the 44th and 45th presidents, White House press secretary Sean Spicer downplayed any tensions. ""I think that they'll be just fine,"" Spicer said. CNN's Kate Bennett contributed to this report. This story has been updated to reflect CNN's latest reporting."

"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump said he believes former President Barack Obama has been behind the leaks within his administration and the sizable, angry town hall crowds Republicans have faced across the country. Trump was asked in an interview on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" if he believed Obama was responsible for the town hall protests against Republicans this month.  ""It turns out his organization seems to do a lot of these organizing to some of the protests that these Republicans are seeing around the country against you. Do you believe President Obama is behind it and if he is, is that a violation of the so-called unsaid presidents' code?"" Trump was asked. ""No, I think he is behind it. I also think it is politics, that's the way it is,"" Trump replied. Trump then discussed the leaks that have disrupted his first month in office. ""You never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes. You know, you're probably right or possibly right, but you never know,"" Trump said in the interview, a clip of which was released Monday night. ""No, I think that President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly behind it. And some of the leaks possibly come from that group, which are really serious because they are very bad in terms of national security. But I also understand that is politics. In terms of him being behind things, that's politics. And it will probably continue."" Trump did not offer any evidence for his claim in the clip released by Fox Monday night. CNN has reached out to Obama's office for comment. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to expand Tuesday on Trump's claim that Obama was behind the protests, telling reporters that she would let the comments stand by themselves.  When asked if the White House believes Obama is behind the protests, Sanders added, ""I think the bottom line here is we all have condemned the protests. I think that is the bigger story here, and the focus we should be talking about that this isn't something that helps and moves us forward and that is what we are focused on right now."" A broad coalition of groups, including Organizing For Action, the SEIU, MoveOn.org and the Center for American Progress have been working to help with grassroots organizing around GOP town halls. Organizing for Action, the group formed from Obama's campaign organization, has 14 professional organizers, for example, who are involved in teaching local activists skills to effectively vocalize opposition to the GOP's top agenda items. Earlier this month, Trump told Fox News that reports of his calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia were caused by leaks from ""Obama people."" Trump's administration has been beset by leaks within his administration to the media, and he has continually railed against those doing the leaking and the media since taking office. He has said the leaks are damaging to national security. Approval ratings for the President's job performance have been at historic lows. A recent Quinnipiac University survey found that 55% of American voters disapprove of Trump's performance. But the President said he would give himself an ""A"" in achievement but in messaging a ""C or C plus."" ""In terms of messaging, I would give myself a C or a C plus,"" Trump said. ""In terms of achievement I think I'd give myself an A. Because I've done great things, but I don't think we've explained it well enough to the American people.""

"Washington (CNN)Former President George W. Bush and Michelle Obama are surprisingly close considering their political differences, and the 43rd president credits the former first lady's appreciation for his sense of humor as a key reason. The unlikely pair have often been photographed together during formal events. When Obama embraced Bush at the opening ceremony for the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture last September, the photo of their warm interaction went viral. George Bush returns to the political scene ""When I saw her, it was a genuine expression of affection,"" Bush told People magazine as he reflected on the moment. The interview was posted on Wednesday. The former President is back in the public eye to promote his new book, ""Portraits of Courage,"" a volume of his paintings of military veterans. ""She kind of likes my sense of humor. Anybody who likes my sense of humor, I immediately like,"" Bush said. The pair are often seated next to each other during events, including the interfaith memorial service for the victims of the Dallas police shooting in July, last year's funeral for former first lady Nancy Reagan and the 2015 commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the historic civil rights march in Selma, Alabama. ""I can't remember where else I've sat next to her, but I probably have a few wisecracks and she seemed to like it OK,"" Bush said. ""I needle her a little bit and around her, I'm fairly lighthearted. (The Obamas) are around serious people all the time and we just took to each other."" Most recently, the Bushes attended President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, where they were seen chatting with the Obamas. "
"Washington (CNN)House minority leader Nancy Pelosi accused President Donald Trump of using ""authoritarian"" tactics by claiming -- without any evidence -- that President Barack Obama ordered that he be wiretapped.  In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Pelosi called Trump the ""deflector-in-chief -- anything to change the subject.""  The California Democrat called Trump's assertions ""just ridiculous"" and a ""smear.""  But it's a tactic Trump often uses, she said. ""You make up something and then you have the press write about it, and then you say, 'everybody's writing about this charge,'"" Pelosi said. ""It's a tool of an authoritarian, to just have you always be talking about what you want to be talking about.""  Pelosi also questioned the sincerity of Trump's request that Congress investigate whether Obama wiretapped him. ""And then to take it to the Congress and say, 'you investigate this,' when he's been not in favor of Congress investigating anything, including what do the Russians have on Donald Trump, politically, financially, or personally,"" Pelosi said, suggesting Trump wasn't serious about his request that Congress look into whether the Obama administration abused its investigative powers during the 2016 campaign. White House press secretary Sean Spicer announced the President's request in a statement Sunday morning. ""Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling,"" Spicer said, posting the statement on Twitter. ""President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. ""Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted,"" he added, without further details on Trump's request. In her Sunday interview, Pelosi also addressed her claim last week that she'd never met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the diplomat whose meetings with Attorney General Jeff Sessions prompted members of Congress pressure Sessions to recuse himself from all investigations connected to Trump's campaign.  A 2010 photo revealed that Pelosi and other congressional leaders had, in fact, sat at a table with Kislyak and other Russian officials during a meeting with President Dmitry Medvedev. Pelosi said that meeting was ""completely different"" than Sessions' meetings with Kislyak.  ""We were meeting with the president of Russia,"" Pelosi said. ""He brought an entourage in with him. He was the one doing the talking. The question is, have you met with him. No, I haven't met with him, I met with the president of Russia. Who else was in his entourage? Who knows?""  "
"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump is slamming his predecessor, Barack Obama, over his decision to release detainees from Guantanamo Bay, saying many of them have ""returned to the battlefield."" ""122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. The President's figure is correct. His attribution, however, is wrong. Trump provided no evidence to support his claim and did not indicate his reason for making it. But on Monday, the Pentagon announced that a recent airstrike against al Qaeda in Yemen killed a former inmate, Yasir al Silmi, who was released during Obama's presidency. And shortly before the President tweeted Tuesday morning, a ""Fox and Friends"" segment mentioned the 122 figure.  The segment, however, did not attribute the source of the 122 figure and did not lay the blame squarely at Obama's feet for the alleged activities of the 122 prisoners released. That's probably because a July 15, 2016, report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which tracks recidivism among former inmates, found that most of the 122 ex-detainees who the US government believes have re-engaged in ""terrorist or insurgent"" activity since they were released from the prison were let out before Obama's presidency began. Of the 532 released prisoners prior to Obama's presidency, the director of national intelligence describes 113 of them as being confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorism, with an additional 75 suspected of doing so, said the report, which was publicly released in September. Of the 161 inmates released between when Obama took office in January 2009 and July 2016, nine are described as having returned to supporting terror groups. An additional 11 are ""suspected"" of having gone back to terrorist activity, the report said. Any of these numbers fall far short of Trump's 122. Because Trump only blames the Obama administration for the 122 former inmates who ""returned to the battlefield"" despite the majority of them being released prior to Obama taking office, we rate Trump's claim to be false. CNN's Tom Kludt contributed to this report."

"Washington (CNN)A day after a secret FBI briefing, the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee told CNN Friday that they still have yet to see any evidence to back up President Donald Trump's stunning claims that the Obama administration spied on him. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee told CNN Friday that, after meeting with the FBI director, he has not ""seen any evidence"" to back Trump's claims that he was wiretapped by the Obama administration during the campaign. ""I think when (press secretary) Sean Spicer isn't even willing to talk about it, you know there's a real problem,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, who was in a meeting with FBI Director James Comey Thursday night. Asked if Comey is prepared to talk about the issue at a March 20 hearing before the committee, Schiff replied, ""he certainly is prepared for the question, and I don't see any reason why he wouldn't answer it. He might even welcome the opportunity."" Rep. Devin Nunes, the GOP chairman of the committee, said that his panel has sent letters to ""multiple agencies"" to obtain records by next week ahead of the March 20 hearing. And he said that he still stands by his assertion from earlier this week that he has yet to see evidence confirming Trump's Saturday morning tweet that then-President Barack Obama ordered wiretaps to spy on him during the presidential campaign. ""I'll let my comments stand from the other day, which I still think are the same,"" Nunes told CNN. ""We are very interested in looking into anything to do with (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) -- especially FISA on any Americans."" He later reiterated that his views are the same from Tuesday when he said that ""I have not seen that evidence"" when asked at the time if there is any data to back up Trump's wiretapping accusation. Schiff, a California Democrat, noted that it is still early in the investigation. On Thursday, he said the investigation into Trump's unverified allegations would be public. ""I think what Sean Spicer and the President wanted was to take this spurious claim and try to bury it in a closed hearing in the intelligence committee. We're not going to allow that to happen. We're going to air this very publicly,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" The Trump administration has so far declined to provide any information about the President's allegations since he tweeted them Saturday. Obama's former aides have emphatically denied Trump's claims, and sources told CNN Obama himself was exasperated after learning of the accusations. ""Nothing has changed,"" Spicer told CNN's Jim Acosta Wednesday when asked whether there was new evidence to support the claims. ""It's not a question of new proof or less proof or whatever. The answer is the same, which is that, I think, there was a concern about what happened in the 2016 election."" The White House spokesman said the intelligence committees have the capabilities to look into the issue objectively. Schiff said Thursday that Trump will be ""exposed"" publicly if an investigation reveals that there is no merit to his claims. The intelligence committee already planned to investigate the relationship between Trump associates and Russian officials during the 2016 election.  ""If the President is going to make outlandish claims like this in the future, he needs to know he will be exposed and high-ranking people within the US government -- like the director of our intelligence agencies and the FBI -- will be forced to say the President wasn't telling the truth,"" he said. Trump making accusations without providing evidence is harmful to democracy and will continue if he is not challenged. ""If we don't confront him on this, you can expect he's going to make other equally false claims in the future and this is not only hurting him but it's hurting the presidency,"" Schiff said earlier. ""It's hurting our credibility around the world."" ""I think there are profound questions about whether this President is capable of growing with the job,"" he added.

"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN)President Donald Trump is back to attacking his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. In a series of tweets early Saturday morning, Trump called Obama a ""bad"" or ""sick"" person after accusing him, without evidence, of ordering the government to tap his phones during the 2016 presidential campaign. While attacks from Trump aimed at Obama are nothing we haven't seen before, they come after months of restraint and even complimentary comments Trump has made about his predecessor since he was elected president. And they marked a return to Trump's earlier treatment of Obama. The relationship is all best summed up in a comment Trump made on Fox News in late January: ""What amazed me is that I was vicious to him in statements, he was vicious to me in statements, and here we are getting along, we're riding up Pennsylvania Avenue. ... We don't even mention it. I guess that's the world of politics."" Here's a look back at some of what Trump has had to say about Obama over the years: March 2011 ""I want him to show his birth certificate. ... There's something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like."" -- Trump on ""The View"" on March 23, 2011. Trump launched himself into the national political conversation in March 2011, when he began to publicly question whether Obama was born in the United States -- effectively taking a megaphone to a conspiracy theory that for years had swirled in conservative circles. August 2012 ""An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud,"" he tweeted on August 6, 2012. Trump continued to accuse Obama of not being born in the US for several years after Obama released his birth certificate.  November 2015 ""I think he's a threat to our country,"" Trump said on a radio show. January 2016 ""Obama is one of the worst negotiators on everything I've ever seen except for when it comes to dealing with the Republicans,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC News. March 2016 ""He may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me,"" Trump said at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference. June 2016 ""There's something going on,"" Trump intoned about Obama in a June interview, suggesting Obama was sympathetic to radical Islamist terrorists. ""You know, people cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism,"" he said on Fox News. ""There's something going on — it's inconceivable. There's something going on."" August 2016 ""I think he's the worst president maybe in the history of our country,"" said Trump on Fox News. He also called Obama a ""disaster,"" ""weak"" and ""ineffective"" in the interview, echoing many of his criticisms of Obama on the campaign trail. August, 2016 ""ISIS is honoring President Obama. He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder. He founded ISIS,"" Trump said at an August 10, 2016, campaign rally. November 10, 2016 Obama is a ""good man,"" Trump said in the Oval Office after meeting Obama for first time. ""Really good meeting, great chemistry,"" Trump tweeted after meeting with Obama at the White House. Earlier that day, he told Obama it was a ""great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many, many more times,"" saying he would seek Obama's counsel. December 7, 2016 ""I must tell you, you know, I never met him before this. I never spoke to him before this. I really -- I do like him,"" Trump said in interview about his predecessor. Trump added that he was seeking Obama's advice on appointments and has been taking ""his recommendations very seriously."" December 28, 2016 ""Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!"" Trump tweeted. Later, Trump added: ""I'm getting along very well with him ... other than a couple of statements (that) I responded to and we talked about it and smiled about it."" ""We are never going to be going against each other,"" he added. January 22, 2017 ""I just went to the Oval Office and found this beautiful letter from President Obama. It was really very nice of him to do that. And I will cherish that,"" Trump said. February 6, 2017 ""We get along, I don't know if he'll admit this, but he likes me. I like him,"" Trump said during his Super Bowl interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly.  February 27, 2017 ""I think he is behind it. I also think it is politics, that's the way it is,"" Trump said, accusing Obama of being responsible for protests against Republicans. March 4, 2017 ""Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!"" Trump tweeted, adding, ""Bad (or sick) guy!"" "
"Washington (CNN)Former White House officials are strongly refuting President Donald Trump's stunning allegation that his predecessor, Barack Obama, wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower ahead of the 2016 election.  Although Obama has yet to respond to the claim himself, a spokesman to Obama called ""any suggestion"" that Obama or any White House official ordered surveillance against Trump ""simply false."" ""A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,"" Kevin Lewis said in a statement early Saturday afternoon. ""As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any US citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false."" Obama himself was at the National Gallery of Art in Washington Sunday with his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, People magazine reported. Building on Lewis' remarks, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who served under Obama, said Sunday that the intelligence agencies he supervised did not wiretap Trump last year, nor did the FBI obtain a court order through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor Trump's phones. ""For the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign,"" Clapper said Sunday morning on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" When asked whether he could confirm or deny whether the FBI could have tapped Trump's phones under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Clapper said, ""I can deny it,"" adding that, to his knowledge, there was no court order to monitor any phones at Trump Tower. A host of other Obama-era officials also weighed in to refute Trump's allegation. Ben Rhodes, who served on the National Security Council for the Obama administration, fired back at Trump's allegations. ""No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you,"" Rhodes tweeted Saturday morning.  He added that only a ""liar"" could make the case that Obama tapped Trump's phones prior to the election.  Former press secretary Josh Earnest told ABC News' Martha Raddatz on Sunday that Trump's wiretap claim is an attempt to distract from a ""growing scandal"" over the Trump administration's alleged ties to Russian officials.  ""President Trump is working very hard to try to distract the American public and the news media from the growing scandal about why his administration and why he himself has, at best, not been forthcoming about their talks and their ties with Russia,"" Earnest said in the interview.  Trump made the claims in a series of tweets on Saturday morning, without citing any evidence. His tweets are just the latest in a string of accusations since taking office that either directly contradicted the facts or lacked evidence to substantiate his claims, and they come just days after Trump was widely praised for the unifying tone of his joint address to Congress. ""Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!"" Trump tweeted early Saturday morning in one part of a six-tweet rant that began just after 6:30 a.m.  "
"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN)Democrats sharply criticized President Donald Trump's calls on lawmakers Sunday to investigate his baseless claim that former President Barack Obama tapped his phone.  Republicans, meanwhile, urged Trump to let the House and Senate intelligence committees do their jobs.  Both parties made clear that Trump's allegation -- which the White House has not offered any evidence to support, and which Obama administration officials emphatically deny -- won't be dropped anytime soon, as even GOP lawmakers who have backed Trump said they'd investigate.  Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said his committee would look into whether the federal government was conducting wiretapping of campaign officials as part of the panel's investigation into Russian meddling in the US election. ""One of the focus points of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation is the U.S. government's response to actions taken by Russian intelligence agents during the presidential campaign,"" Nunes said in a statement Sunday. ""As such, the Committee will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party's campaign officials or surrogates, and we will continue to investigate this issue if the evidence warrants it."" Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee announced Sunday night they planned to ask White House Counsel Donald McGahn to provide the committee with a list of communications between the White House and the Department of Justice regarding probes into Russian interference in the election. Other Democrats, meanwhile, accused Trump of advancing yet another unfounded conspiracy in an effort to distract from the issues dogging his administration in its early weeks.  ""You make up something and then you have the press write about it, and then you say, 'everybody's writing about this charge,'"" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""It's a tool of an authoritarian, to just have you always be talking about what you want to be talking about."" Their comments come after Trump's aides asked Congress to look into whether the Obama administration abused its investigative powers during the 2016 election. ""Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in the statement, which he also posted on Twitter. ""President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. ""Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted,"" Spicer added. He did not provide any further details on the President's request to Congress. RELATED: Trump's baseless wiretap claim While Spicer said ""reports"" prompted the call for a congressional investigation, the White House still has not provided any evidence to back up the President's accusations. There are no publicly known credible reports to back up Trump's claim that Obama ordered Trump's phones be monitored. Frustrated that the Russia stories have overshadowed a widely praised performance in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, Trump angrily raised the wiretapping issue unprompted in conversations with friends and acquaintances at Mar-a-Lago, two people who have spoken with him at his Palm Beach resort over the last 24 hours said on Sunday. The President didn't specify what information he was basing his accusations upon, but told them he expected an investigation to prove him right. Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy posted a column Sunday saying he spoke with the President twice on Saturday about the wiretap story. ""When I mentioned Obama 'denials' about the wiretaps, he shot back: 'This will be investigated, it will all come out. I will be proven right,"" Ruddy wrote. Multiple former senior US officials have dismissed Trump's allegations, however, calling them ""nonsense"" and ""false."" Obama, through a spokesman, also rejected the claim that he ordered Trump's phones tapped. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, a career intelligence official who had oversight of the US intelligence community in that role, said Sunday that Trump was not wiretapped by intelligence agencies nor did the FBI obtain a court order through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor Trump's phones. ""For the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign,"" Clapper said Sunday morning on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Members of the intelligence committees  House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff called Trump's claims as ""destructive as it was baseless,"" but tied the President's call to the California Democrat's criticism of FBI Director James Comey for not being forthcoming about any investigation of ties between Russia and the Trump administration. ""If the administration truly believes that President Obama illegally eavesdropped on the Trump campaign and wants our committee to investigate the matter, they should join my call on Director Comey to answer any question put to him that is pertinent to the Russia investigation,"" Schiff said in a statement.  The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Richard Burr of North Carolina, said his panel would follow the evidence trail in its investigation of Russian intelligence activities. ""As I've said since the beginning and have repeated since, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence will follow the evidence where it leads, and we will continue to be guided by the intelligence and facts as we compile our findings,"" Burr said. Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted at Spicer that he looks forward ""to seeing your evidence,"" calling the allegations a ""mess."" Himes also mocked Trump's claim in a tweet Sunday. ""BREAKING: HIMES ADMITS TO TAPPING. 'I know this will end up being sticky, but yes, I did the tapping' #maplenotwire"" he tweeted with a picture of him tapping a tree for syrup. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he's ""not sure what it is (Trump) is talking about,"" but added it's possible that ""perhaps the President has information that is not yet available to us or to the public."" Rubio pointed out that the Senate Intelligence Committee is already in the process of reviewing Russia's meddling in the US elections last year and will eventually issue a public report.  ""But what I think we should do is, everybody needs to take a deep breath and calm down here,"" the Florida Republican told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""And let's go through this as what we are doing. In the Senate Intelligence Committee, we are working in a bipartisan way to collect facts that involve reviewing classified and sometimes unclassified and open-source information."" Sen. Susan Collins, also a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday morning that she has ""seen no evidence"" to back up Trump's wiretapping allegation and called on the White House to turn over any evidence to the committee. ""What we need to deal with is evidence, not statements,"" the Maine Republican said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Democratic leaders  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he believes Trump is ""in trouble"" whether there was a court order authorizing surveillance of his phones or ""if he falsely spread this kind of misinformation."" ""If he falsely spread this kind of misinformation, that is so wrong. It's beneath the dignity of the presidency. It is something that really hurts people's view of government,"" the New York Democrat said Sunday on ""Meet the Press."" ""On the other hand, if it's true, it's even worse for the President. Because that means that a federal judge, independently elected, has found probable cause that the president, or people on his staff, have probable cause to have broken the law or to have interacted with a foreign agent. Now that's serious stuff."" RELATED: Graham vows to 'get to the bottom' of Trump's wiretapping claims Schumer said he had no problem with the congressional intelligence committees including Trump's request in their investigation into Russian activity in the 2016 election, but he also used the call as an opportunity to reiterate Democrats' calls for a special prosecutor to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. CNN's Manu Raju, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report."
" (CNN)Andrew Jackson may be giving way to Harriet Tubman on the face of the $20 bill, but the seventh president's image is on the ascent in the modern White House. On his fifth day in office, President Donald Trump elevated a portrait of his distant predecessor to a place in the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump flew south to Nashville, Tennessee, where he visited the Hermitage, Jackson's home, and placed a wreath at his tomb. ""It was during the revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite -- does that sound familiar to you?"" Trump said to cheers. ""I wonder why they keep talking about Trump and Jackson, and Jackson and Trump."" His next destination hinted at an explanation. After brief remarks, Trump rolled over to the Music City's Municipal Auditorium for a rally with supporters. It's an appropriate venue if only for its proximity to Jackson, the first president elected on a populist platform, and one known to have enjoyed the close company of his most spirited backers.  Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor, Steve Bannon, has endorsed and promoted the comparison. In a post-election interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the former Breitbart boss compared his new patron to Old Hickory. ""Like (Andrew) Jackson's populism, we're going to build an entirely new political movement,"" he said. ""It's everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy."" Mostly though, the conservatives have fallen in line. Trump moved toward them as he hammered out his Cabinet. But the fight over health care reform has exposed familiar fissures in the Republican Party. The President is navigating them carefully -- for now, at least.  The Jackson analogies are not entirely off base, but they have their limits. Unlike Trump, Jackson was not born into wealth. And while he made his fortune in due time, he also collected government checks as a military general and during multiple stints in Congress. When Jackson failed in his first run at the presidency, in 1824, he said the game had been rigged against him -- and the facts agreed. Indeed, he won the popular vote. But none of the four candidates that year won an electoral college majority, so the contest went to the House of Representatives and the speaker, Henry Clay, traded his considerable influence for a place as John Quincy Adams' secretary of state.   Of course, to say that Trump differs from Jackson should, in many cases, be a welcome observation. Jackson, both before and during his presidency, had been brutal with the Native American population, then ruthless in driving them from their ancestral homes. A few months after signing the Indian Removal Act in 1830, he addressed his former colleagues.  ""It gives me pleasure,"" he said, ""to announce to Congress that the benevolent policy of the government, steadily pursued for nearly 30 years, in relation to the removal of the Indians beyond the white settlements is approaching to a happy consummation."" As he spoke those words, the Trail of Tears was nearly a decade off, and by 1840, Native communities would, largely by Jackson's policies, be almost entirely wiped out of the American Southeast. It is for that, and his support of slavery, that Jackson ultimately lost his place on the twenty. During the campaign, Trump called the decision, made by President Barack Obama's Treasury Department, ""pure political correctness.""  But the candidate had kind words for Tubman, too. She was, Trump said, ""fantastic."" "
" (CNN)Do you love those Obama-Biden bromance memes? You are not alone.  Former Vice President Joe Biden is well aware of the many memes flooding the internet, and he's picked his favorite. Biden's daughter, Ashley, took credit for introducing her dad to the memes in an interview with Moneyish. When he first learned about them, he ""sat there for an hour and laughed,"" she told the website. "
"Washington (CNN)She's kept a low profile since leaving the White House, but former first lady Michelle Obama was back in the spotlight Thursday night, making an appearance on Fox's ""MasterChef Junior."" And yes, vegetables were involved.  Obama was a special guest on the mystery challenge portion of the child cooking reality television competition. The episode was taped prior to inauguration when her husband, President Barack Obama, was still in office.  As the episode began, a man dressed in a suit, sunglasses and American flag pin brought host and celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, an official-looking red phone. Ramsay placed a call, asking to speak to ""the boss of the house ... no, not him, I need the real boss of the house."" Michelle Obama's healthy lunch program may be in jeopardy The suit-clad man whispered something into his sleeve, and a screen came down from the ceiling, complete with fog special effects.  Then, she appeared on the screen. ""I'm Michelle Obama, and tonight, I am thrilled to deliver your next mystery box challenge. Please head back to your stations,"" the then-first lady said.  The final 14 young cooks in the competition, aged 8 to 13, gasped and shrieked with surprise, racing to their kitchen stations.  ""I'm like, about to die. R.I.P. me, oh my God. I mean, Michelle Obama is a wonder woman and I look up to her so much. She is my idol,"" contestant Jasmine, 11, said.  Contestants lifted the lids of their weekly mystery boxes to reveal ingredients inspired by the White House kitchen garden.  ""For your mystery box challenge, I'm asking all of you to come up with an original recipe that's healthy and follows the 'my plate' symbol, filing half your plate with fruits and veggies, and the rest with whole grains, lean protein and dairy,"" Obama instructed. The challenge wasn't met with enthusiasm by all the young chefs.  ""Michelle Obama wants me to cook vegetables. Not happening. I don't like vegetables, they're evil,"" said Donovan, 9 (Donovan was eliminated later in the episode).  But there was an incentive to a well-cooked vegetable: The winner of the mystery box challenge, Obama said, would win a trip to the White House to attend the annual kids' state dinner.  Then, the heat was on: The contestants had one hour to get cooking, slicing, dicing and creatively using the ingredients in dishes like a lemon branzino, parmesan quinoa and strawberry kale salad.  After a thorough look and tasting by the judges, the verdict was in. Only one contestant was White House-bound; 11-year-old Justise's pan-seared shrimp with sautéed bell peppers, carrots, eggplant and quinoa won the mystery box challenge. Justise attended Obama's final Kids' State Dinner in July 2016, per Fox spokeswoman Annie Geffroy.  ""I am sad that this is my last Kids' State Dinner, but it's not the last of the work that we're going to do on this issue, right?"" Obama said at the time.  Obama frequently used television and social media to promote her ""Let's Move"" initiative to encourage exercise and healthy eating for children. She appeared on PBS' ""Sesame Street,"" Funny or Die's ""Billy on the Street,"" and showcased her best mom dancing on NBC's ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon."" And she went viral with a 2014 vine, saying, ""Turnip? For what?"" a play on the DJ Snake and Lil Jon song, ""Turn Down for What.""  Obama's healthy food legacy continues at the White House: First lady Melania Trump has promised to carry her garden torch. ""As a mother and as the first lady of this country, Mrs. Trump is committed to the preservation and continuation of the White House Gardens, specifically the first lady's Kitchen Garden and the Rose Garden,"" Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, senior adviser to the first lady, said in a statement to CNN last month.  However, the fate of one of Obama's signature achievements may be in question: A key lobbying group, the School Nutrition Association, released recommendations earlier this month to scale back federal nutrition standards she championed and were set under the Obama administration.  The association's recommendations would roll back key provisions of the ""Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act,"" legislation spearheaded by Obama, and her ""Let's Move!"" campaign. "

"Washington (CNN)Former President George W. Bush and Michelle Obama are surprisingly close considering their political differences, and the 43rd president credits the former first lady's appreciation for his sense of humor as a key reason. The unlikely pair have often been photographed together during formal events. When Obama embraced Bush at the opening ceremony for the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture last September, the photo of their warm interaction went viral. George Bush returns to the political scene ""When I saw her, it was a genuine expression of affection,"" Bush told People magazine as he reflected on the moment. The interview was posted on Wednesday. The former President is back in the public eye to promote his new book, ""Portraits of Courage,"" a volume of his paintings of military veterans. ""She kind of likes my sense of humor. Anybody who likes my sense of humor, I immediately like,"" Bush said. The pair are often seated next to each other during events, including the interfaith memorial service for the victims of the Dallas police shooting in July, last year's funeral for former first lady Nancy Reagan and the 2015 commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the historic civil rights march in Selma, Alabama. ""I can't remember where else I've sat next to her, but I probably have a few wisecracks and she seemed to like it OK,"" Bush said. ""I needle her a little bit and around her, I'm fairly lighthearted. (The Obamas) are around serious people all the time and we just took to each other."" Most recently, the Bushes attended President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, where they were seen chatting with the Obamas. "
"Estos tuits llegan en un momento en que el presidente Trump  está enfrentando peticiones para que su segunda elección de gabinete renuncie, luego de que se revelara que el secretario de Justicia, Jeff Sessions, no había mencionado sus reuniones con el embajador ruso, Sergey Kislyak, en su audiencia de confirmación el mes pasado. "
"West Palm Beach, Fla. (CNN)President Donald Trump made a stunning claim Saturday, alleging without offering evidence that his predecessor, Barack Obama, wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower ahead of the 2016 election.  ""Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!"" Trump tweeted early Saturday morning in one part of a six-tweet tirade that began just after 6:30 a.m. The President went on to compare the alleged tapping of his phones to Watergate and called Obama ""bad (or sick).""   ""How low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy,"" Trump tweeted. But two former senior US officials quickly dismissed Trump's accusations out of hand. ""Just nonsense,"" said one former senior US intelligence official. Another former senior US official with direct knowledge of investigations by the Justice Department under the Obama administration said Trump's phones were never tapped. ""This did not happen. It is false. Wrong,"" the former official told CNN. A spokesman for Obama, Kevin Lewis, called ""any suggestion"" that Obama or any White House official ordered surveillance against Trump ""simply false."" ""A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,"" Lewis said in a statement early Saturday afternoon. ""As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any US citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.""  The former senior US official with direct knowledge of the Justice Department's investigations said Obama could not have ordered such a warrant. It would have been taken to a judge by investigators, but investigators never sought a warrant to monitor Trump's phones, the former official said. A federal judge would only have approved a warrant to wiretap Trump's phones if he or she had found probable cause that Trump had committed a federal crime or was a foreign agent. Former Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes echoed the point in a tweet responding to Trump on Saturday morning. ""No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you,"" he said in his Twitter post. Warrants to tap into someone's phones in the course of a federal investigation would be sought by the Department of Justice, which conducts investigations independent of the White House and the President. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, an independent and secretive federal court, is responsible for issuing surveillance warrants in cases concerning foreign intelligence. The FBI has been investigating contacts between Trump campaign advisers and Russians known to US intelligence, and that court would likely be the forum to petition for such a warrant. When asked if the White House is seeking any possible Foreign Surveillance Cout documentation to back up the President's claims, White House Counsel Donald McGahn ""is reviewing what options if any are available to us,"" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told CNN.  But White House officials could not say whether any such documentation exists. There is no evidence such a document on surveillance of Trump himself exists, according to sources with knowledge of the situation whom CNN spoke to Saturday. The intelligence court's records are some of the most secretive intelligence documents. The White House could seek possible records from the Justice Department. If it did that, it would be unheard of and a breach of protocol, University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck, an expert on national security law, told CNN. Protocol has dictated that the Justice Department would be insulated from such White House requests for these types of documents. The New York Times first reported on McGahn's review. A senior administration official in Washington said colleagues learned of the tweet storm about Obama only after Trump sent them. They were not expecting the President to make any news this morning before golfing in Palm Beach, Florida. The official said they don't believe Trump is trying to get ahead of any particular story that's about to come out, but rather he is furious about how the Russia storyline is playing out. The official pointed to a story on the conservative website Breitbart News that was circulating in the West Wing, which followed up on comments from radio talk show Mark Levin claiming Obama worked to undermine Trump's presidential campaign and his administration, including various investigations on Russia and possible ties between Russians and Trump associates. That story infuriated him, the official said. Trump's tweets came two days after his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from any investigation related to the Trump campaign. Some Democrats have continued to call for Sessions' resignation after he acknowledged meeting multiple times with the Russian ambassador to the US during the campaign despite denying any contacts during his Senate confirmation hearing. A pattern Trump's tweets Saturday morning are just the latest in a string of wild accusations he has made since taking office that either directly contradicted the facts or lacked evidence to substantiate his claims, and they come just days after Trump was widely praised for the unifying tone of his joint address to Congress. While past presidents have spoken prudently about sensitive matters to ensure that any claims they make are backed up by carefully vetted facts, Trump has instead maintained his pre-presidency style: one defined by unsubstantiated claims bellowed off the cuff or tweeted at odd hours of the day. Trump has made dozens of verifiably false or misleading claims since taking office, often with an eye on gaining a political advantage or blunting criticism. The President has repeatedly trumpeted the debunked claim that millions of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election and accused journalists of inventing a rift between him and the US intelligence community, despite his own statements to that effect. And last month, he accused a Democratic senator of misrepresenting his Supreme Court nominee's criticism of him, even after the nominee's White House-appointed spokesman corroborated the senator's account of the conversation. Meanwhile, Trump and his advisers have falsely accused the media of leading a ""fake news"" campaign to smear his presidency, all the while arguing in favor of ""alternative facts."" Congressional reaction Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has been critical of Trump, said during a town hall forum Saturday that he didn't know if Trump's claim was true, but said he was ""very worried"" about the allegation. ""I'm very worried. I'm very worried that our President is suggesting that the former President's done something illegally,"" Graham said. ""I would be very worried if in fact the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governments. So it's my job as a United States senator to get to the bottom of this. I promise you I will."" California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, which is also probing the scope of Russia's influence on the US election, said in a statement Saturday afternoon in reference to one of Trump's tweets: ""If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation's chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them.  ""No matter how much we hope and pray that this President will grow into one who respects and understands the Constitution, separation of powers, role of a free press, responsibilities as the leader of the free world, or demonstrates even the most basic regard for the truth, we must now accept that President Trump will never become that man,"" Schiff said. Amid criticism that Trump's allegations were meritless, one GOP senator called on Trump to release proof about his accusation, saying the President's allegations were ""very serious."" Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a frequent Trump critic, said the President should publicly release the FISA Court order that would have been needed if his phones were legally tapped by the government. And, if Trump believes his phones were illegally monitored, he ""should explain what sort of wiretap it was and how he knows this,"" Sasse said in a statement. ""We are in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public trust, and the President's allegations today demand the thorough and dispassionate attention of serious patriots,"" Sasse said. ""A quest for the full truth, rather than knee-jerk partisanship, must be our guide if we are going to rebuild civic trust and health.""

"Washington (CNN)The National Park Service has released a series of aerial and ground shots that show the crowd sizes during the last three presidential inaugurations in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from various media outlets. The images show the crowd sizes of President Barack Obama's 2009 and 2013 inaugurations, as well as President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. The turnout represented in the photos for Trump's inauguration was smaller than that of his predecessor. The Park Service did not indicate the precise times that the photos were taken. ""The NPS does not have a position or comment about the photos,"" NPS spokesman Tom Crosson told CNN in an email Tuesday. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. CNN previously reported that the Trump administration asked the Interior Department's digital team in January to temporarily stop using Twitter after the National Park Service retweeted messages that negatively compared the crowd sizes at Obama's 2009 inauguration to Trump's inauguration. But Crosson denied that the White House was involved, saying that the agency's Twitter activity was halted due to ""unauthorized tweets."" ""The NPS halted Twitter activity for just over 12 hours that day because we thought our national Twitter account was compromised based on unauthorized tweets posted by our account,"" Crosson said. ""Once we determined the source of the unauthorized tweets, all Twitter activity in the NPS resumed. We have received no guidance from the administration relating to our social media accounts."" The retweet of early crowd size comparisons has since been deleted. Later, NPS apologized for the post, tweeting, ""We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you."" This issue of crowd size has been a point of contention for the Trump White House, which has repeatedly accused the media of understating the President's inauguration crowd sizes. On day two of his presidency, Trump lashed out at the news media over the size of his inauguration crowd during a visit to the CIA headquarters and after massive nationwide protests erupted against his administration, most notably the Women's March on January 21. ""We had a massive field of people. You saw that — packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. I said wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out the field was, it looked like a million, a million and half people, they showed a field where there was practically nobody standing there,"" Trump said. From Trump's point of view as he gave his inaugural address, the crowd undoubtedly appeared quite large, but the newly released photos dispute the President's claim that the crowd stretched ""all the way back to the Washington monument."" "
"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama have not spoken since the inauguration, but their respective advisers have. Two people familiar with the matter say Trump's White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and Obama's former White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, have spoken since Trump claimed, without evidence, that Obama had him wiretapped. There have also been conversations between other former Obama officials and Trump officials since Saturday. ""There is a dialogue,"" one person familiar with the conversations said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the talks. The question is whether these talks among advisers will ultimately lead to a conversation between the 44th and 45th presidents. Spokesmen for Trump and Obama declined to comment. Obama was irked and exasperated in response to his successor's uncorroborated  wiretapping accusation, sources close to the former president tell CNN, though these sources say Obama's reaction stopped short of outright fury.  Obama and his aides responded with disbelief when they learned of Trump's Saturday morning tweets laying out the charges. Later in the day, an Obama spokesman said ""neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any US citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false."" The sources provided CNN with slightly different insight into Obama's demeanor than others who told The Wall Street Journal that Obama was ""livid."" Obama's loyal army of supporters have been far more active in voicing their dissatisfaction with Trump. On social media and television, former aides have been aggressively pushing back on Trump in the first weeks of his presidency.  Presidents Trump and Obama have not spoken since Inauguration Day, when Obama welcomed Trump for coffee in the White House and accompanied him to the US Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony. The two men had developed what Trump termed a ""warm"" relationship in the run-up to Trump's inauguration, fostered by an in-person meeting in the Oval Office and several phone conversations. But people close to both men acknowledge that the bitterness of the presidential campaign, paired with Trump's longstanding antagonism toward Obama regarding his birth certificate, would make a close relationship improbable. On the weekend that Trump levied his explosive charges, Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, were spotted at the National Gallery of Art in Washington on a private tour of artist Theaster Gates' new exhibition. The President was all smiles when he departed the museum, dressed casually and carrying a bag from the gallery's gift shop. Asked Monday whether Trump's claims would damage the relationship between the 44th and 45th presidents, White House press secretary Sean Spicer downplayed any tensions. ""I think that they'll be just fine,"" Spicer said. CNN's Kate Bennett contributed to this report. This story has been updated to reflect CNN's latest reporting."
"Washington (CNN)A day after a secret FBI briefing, the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee told CNN Friday that they still have yet to see any evidence to back up President Donald Trump's stunning claims that the Obama administration spied on him. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee told CNN Friday that, after meeting with the FBI director, he has not ""seen any evidence"" to back Trump's claims that he was wiretapped by the Obama administration during the campaign. ""I think when (press secretary) Sean Spicer isn't even willing to talk about it, you know there's a real problem,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, who was in a meeting with FBI Director James Comey Thursday night. Asked if Comey is prepared to talk about the issue at a March 20 hearing before the committee, Schiff replied, ""he certainly is prepared for the question, and I don't see any reason why he wouldn't answer it. He might even welcome the opportunity."" Rep. Devin Nunes, the GOP chairman of the committee, said that his panel has sent letters to ""multiple agencies"" to obtain records by next week ahead of the March 20 hearing. And he said that he still stands by his assertion from earlier this week that he has yet to see evidence confirming Trump's Saturday morning tweet that then-President Barack Obama ordered wiretaps to spy on him during the presidential campaign. ""I'll let my comments stand from the other day, which I still think are the same,"" Nunes told CNN. ""We are very interested in looking into anything to do with (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) -- especially FISA on any Americans."" He later reiterated that his views are the same from Tuesday when he said that ""I have not seen that evidence"" when asked at the time if there is any data to back up Trump's wiretapping accusation. Schiff, a California Democrat, noted that it is still early in the investigation. On Thursday, he said the investigation into Trump's unverified allegations would be public. ""I think what Sean Spicer and the President wanted was to take this spurious claim and try to bury it in a closed hearing in the intelligence committee. We're not going to allow that to happen. We're going to air this very publicly,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" The Trump administration has so far declined to provide any information about the President's allegations since he tweeted them Saturday. Obama's former aides have emphatically denied Trump's claims, and sources told CNN Obama himself was exasperated after learning of the accusations. ""Nothing has changed,"" Spicer told CNN's Jim Acosta Wednesday when asked whether there was new evidence to support the claims. ""It's not a question of new proof or less proof or whatever. The answer is the same, which is that, I think, there was a concern about what happened in the 2016 election."" The White House spokesman said the intelligence committees have the capabilities to look into the issue objectively. Schiff said Thursday that Trump will be ""exposed"" publicly if an investigation reveals that there is no merit to his claims. The intelligence committee already planned to investigate the relationship between Trump associates and Russian officials during the 2016 election.  ""If the President is going to make outlandish claims like this in the future, he needs to know he will be exposed and high-ranking people within the US government -- like the director of our intelligence agencies and the FBI -- will be forced to say the President wasn't telling the truth,"" he said. Trump making accusations without providing evidence is harmful to democracy and will continue if he is not challenged. ""If we don't confront him on this, you can expect he's going to make other equally false claims in the future and this is not only hurting him but it's hurting the presidency,"" Schiff said earlier. ""It's hurting our credibility around the world."" ""I think there are profound questions about whether this President is capable of growing with the job,"" he added. This story has been updated to reflect breaking news. "
" (CNN)Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Wednesday he never gave President Donald Trump any reason to believe the GOP candidate had been wiretapped by the Obama administration during the campaign. Asked by a reporter at an event on crime in Richmond, Virginia, if he ever briefed Trump on ""investigations related to the campaign or did you ever give him any reason to believe that he was wiretapped by the previous administration,"" Sessions replied, ""Look, the answer is no."" Sessions went on to reiterate that he has recused himself from any investigations involving the Trump campaign and transition and said he was not speaking with the President or the people who are investigating the case. He added that he was ""unable to comment on any of these details.""   The attorney general -- who was a top surrogate for Trump's campaign -- also defended meeting with the Russian ambassador to the US last year and reiterated his previous position that he was doing so in his capacity as a senator on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""I never considered meeting with the Russian ambassador to be anything improper in any way,"" Sessions said. ""We did not discuss politics or campaigns. He came in and we discussed issues like Ukraine and things of that nature."" Earlier this month, Trump alleged -- without providing evidence -- that President Barack Obama had his ""wires tapped"" at Trump Tower toward the end of his campaign.  Obama, through a spokesman, has denied the accusation and the White House appeared to walk back the allegation earlier this week when press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump was speaking broadly about surveillance of his campaign. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican, said Wednesday that neither he nor the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, have seen any evidence that Obama wiretapped Trump last year and want the Justice Department to respond to their requests for information by March 20. ""We don't have any evidence that that took place and, in fact, I don't believe -- just in the last week of time, the people we've talked to -- I don't think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower,"" Nunes said at a news conference on Capitol Hill. FBI Director James Comey will testify at a March 20 hearing and there will be a second hearing in the committee March 28. Also Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on CNN's ""New Day"" that he'll subpoena information from the FBI over the wiretapping allegations if Comey does not provide information about whether there is any validity to the claims. CNN's Eleanor Mueller contributed to this report."
" (CNN)A spokesperson for Barack Obama says the former president is not affiliated with a group soliciting donations to oppose President Donald Trump. CNN's KFile reported in February that Progressive Priorities PAC was making robocalls using Obama's voice. ""President Obama needs you urgent help to help fund our fax blast demanding Democrats in Congress block all repeal efforts by Donald Trump, so please press one now to contribute to help President Obama block all repeal efforts by Donald Trump,"" an automated voice can be heard saying on one call obtained by CNN's KFile. ""For generous support we'll send you a free Obama signature gift as a way of saying thank you. Again, press one to contribute now to help President Obama block all repeal efforts by Donald Trump."" Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for the former president, told CNN's KFile, ""These pre-recorded calls were not authorized by President Barack Obama, have no connection to the former President, and have been reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities.""  ""We will continue to monitor for and report any misleading or fraudulent uses of the President's image."" CNN's KFile previously reported that Progressive Priorities PAC is closely tied to a different PAC called Liberty Action Group, which raised nearly $3 million through radio advertisements and robocalls by asking for contributions to help elect Trump. FEC filings for both groups show that neither of them contributed directly to conservative or progressive causes.  Multiple attempts to reach the individuals behind the groups have gone unanswered.  "
"Washington (CNN)Former President Barack Obama has been named the 2017 ""Profile in Courage"" award honoree by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.  The foundation said Thursday it is recognizing Obama for ""expanding health security for millions of Americans, restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba and leading a landmark international accord to combat climate change.""  The award, created in 1989, is given to a public official or group of public servants from any level of government each year ""whose actions demonstrate the qualities of politically courageous leadership in the spirit of 'Profiles in Courage,' President Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer prize-winning book,"" according to the Profile in Courage award website.  Obama isn't the only president who has been so honored: former Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush have also received the award. ""Our country owes a debt of gratitude to President Obama, not just for the many important policy achievements made during his tenure but also for the example of leadership he provided all of us, which we may draw upon in the years to come,"" Jack Schlossberg, the son of JFK's daughter, Caroline Kennedy, said in a statement. Obama will receive the award during a ceremony in May. "
"Washington (CNN)House minority leader Nancy Pelosi accused President Donald Trump of using ""authoritarian"" tactics by claiming -- without any evidence -- that President Barack Obama ordered that he be wiretapped.  In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Pelosi called Trump the ""deflector-in-chief -- anything to change the subject.""  The California Democrat called Trump's assertions ""just ridiculous"" and a ""smear.""  But it's a tactic Trump often uses, she said. ""You make up something and then you have the press write about it, and then you say, 'everybody's writing about this charge,'"" Pelosi said. ""It's a tool of an authoritarian, to just have you always be talking about what you want to be talking about.""  Pelosi also questioned the sincerity of Trump's request that Congress investigate whether Obama wiretapped him. ""And then to take it to the Congress and say, 'you investigate this,' when he's been not in favor of Congress investigating anything, including what do the Russians have on Donald Trump, politically, financially, or personally,"" Pelosi said, suggesting Trump wasn't serious about his request that Congress look into whether the Obama administration abused its investigative powers during the 2016 campaign. White House press secretary Sean Spicer announced the President's request in a statement Sunday morning. ""Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling,"" Spicer said, posting the statement on Twitter. ""President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. ""Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted,"" he added, without further details on Trump's request. In her Sunday interview, Pelosi also addressed her claim last week that she'd never met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the diplomat whose meetings with Attorney General Jeff Sessions prompted members of Congress pressure Sessions to recuse himself from all investigations connected to Trump's campaign.  A 2010 photo revealed that Pelosi and other congressional leaders had, in fact, sat at a table with Kislyak and other Russian officials during a meeting with President Dmitry Medvedev. Pelosi said that meeting was ""completely different"" than Sessions' meetings with Kislyak.  ""We were meeting with the president of Russia,"" Pelosi said. ""He brought an entourage in with him. He was the one doing the talking. The question is, have you met with him. No, I haven't met with him, I met with the president of Russia. Who else was in his entourage? Who knows?""  "
"Washington (CNN)Former White House officials are strongly refuting President Donald Trump's stunning allegation that his predecessor, Barack Obama, wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower ahead of the 2016 election.  Although Obama has yet to respond to the claim himself, a spokesman to Obama called ""any suggestion"" that Obama or any White House official ordered surveillance against Trump ""simply false."" ""A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,"" Kevin Lewis said in a statement early Saturday afternoon. ""As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any US citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false."" Obama himself was at the National Gallery of Art in Washington Sunday with his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, People magazine reported. Building on Lewis' remarks, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who served under Obama, said Sunday that the intelligence agencies he supervised did not wiretap Trump last year, nor did the FBI obtain a court order through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor Trump's phones. ""For the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign,"" Clapper said Sunday morning on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" When asked whether he could confirm or deny whether the FBI could have tapped Trump's phones under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Clapper said, ""I can deny it,"" adding that, to his knowledge, there was no court order to monitor any phones at Trump Tower. A host of other Obama-era officials also weighed in to refute Trump's allegation. Ben Rhodes, who served on the National Security Council for the Obama administration, fired back at Trump's allegations. ""No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you,"" Rhodes tweeted Saturday morning.  He added that only a ""liar"" could make the case that Obama tapped Trump's phones prior to the election.  Former press secretary Josh Earnest told ABC News' Martha Raddatz on Sunday that Trump's wiretap claim is an attempt to distract from a ""growing scandal"" over the Trump administration's alleged ties to Russian officials.  ""President Trump is working very hard to try to distract the American public and the news media from the growing scandal about why his administration and why he himself has, at best, not been forthcoming about their talks and their ties with Russia,"" Earnest said in the interview.  Trump made the claims in a series of tweets on Saturday morning, without citing any evidence. His tweets are just the latest in a string of accusations since taking office that either directly contradicted the facts or lacked evidence to substantiate his claims, and they come just days after Trump was widely praised for the unifying tone of his joint address to Congress. ""Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!"" Trump tweeted early Saturday morning in one part of a six-tweet rant that began just after 6:30 a.m.  "
"Washington (CNN)The National Park Service has released a series of aerial and ground shots that show the crowd sizes during the last three presidential inaugurations in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from various media outlets. The images show the crowd sizes of President Barack Obama's 2009 and 2013 inaugurations, as well as President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. The turnout represented in the photos for Trump's inauguration was smaller than that of his predecessor. The Park Service did not indicate the precise times that the photos were taken. ""The NPS does not have a position or comment about the photos,"" NPS spokesman Tom Crosson told CNN in an email Tuesday. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. CNN previously reported that the Trump administration asked the Interior Department's digital team in January to temporarily stop using Twitter after the National Park Service retweeted messages that negatively compared the crowd sizes at Obama's 2009 inauguration to Trump's inauguration. But Crosson denied that the White House was involved, saying that the agency's Twitter activity was halted due to ""unauthorized tweets."" ""The NPS halted Twitter activity for just over 12 hours that day because we thought our national Twitter account was compromised based on unauthorized tweets posted by our account,"" Crosson said. ""Once we determined the source of the unauthorized tweets, all Twitter activity in the NPS resumed. We have received no guidance from the administration relating to our social media accounts."" The retweet of early crowd size comparisons has since been deleted. Later, NPS apologized for the post, tweeting, ""We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you."" This issue of crowd size has been a point of contention for the Trump White House, which has repeatedly accused the media of understating the President's inauguration crowd sizes. On day two of his presidency, Trump lashed out at the news media over the size of his inauguration crowd during a visit to the CIA headquarters and after massive nationwide protests erupted against his administration, most notably the Women's March on January 21. ""We had a massive field of people. You saw that — packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. I said wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out the field was, it looked like a million, a million and half people, they showed a field where there was practically nobody standing there,"" Trump said. From Trump's point of view as he gave his inaugural address, the crowd undoubtedly appeared quite large, but the newly released photos dispute the President's claim that the crowd stretched ""all the way back to the Washington monument."" "
"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama have not spoken since the inauguration, but their respective advisers have. Two people familiar with the matter say Trump's White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and Obama's former White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, have spoken since Trump claimed, without evidence, that Obama had him wiretapped. There have also been conversations between other former Obama officials and Trump officials since Saturday. ""There is a dialogue,"" one person familiar with the conversations said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the talks. The question is whether these talks among advisers will ultimately lead to a conversation between the 44th and 45th presidents. Spokesmen for Trump and Obama declined to comment. Obama was irked and exasperated in response to his successor's uncorroborated  wiretapping accusation, sources close to the former president tell CNN, though these sources say Obama's reaction stopped short of outright fury.  Obama and his aides responded with disbelief when they learned of Trump's Saturday morning tweets laying out the charges. Later in the day, an Obama spokesman said ""neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any US citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false."" The sources provided CNN with slightly different insight into Obama's demeanor than others who told The Wall Street Journal that Obama was ""livid."" Obama's loyal army of supporters have been far more active in voicing their dissatisfaction with Trump. On social media and television, former aides have been aggressively pushing back on Trump in the first weeks of his presidency.  Presidents Trump and Obama have not spoken since Inauguration Day, when Obama welcomed Trump for coffee in the White House and accompanied him to the US Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony. The two men had developed what Trump termed a ""warm"" relationship in the run-up to Trump's inauguration, fostered by an in-person meeting in the Oval Office and several phone conversations. But people close to both men acknowledge that the bitterness of the presidential campaign, paired with Trump's longstanding antagonism toward Obama regarding his birth certificate, would make a close relationship improbable.

" (CNN)A Republican lawmaker called on President Donald Trump Friday to either provide evidence or apologize to former President Barack Obama for his so-far unverified claim that Trump Tower was wiretapped during the 2016 election. ""I see no indication that that's true and so it's not a charge I would have ever made. And frankly, unless you can produce some pretty compelling proof, then I think that President Obama is owed an apology in that regard,"" Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole said. ""If he didn't do it, (Trump) shouldn't be reckless in accusations that he did,"" he added. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman and the ranking Democrat on the committee said Thursday that they've seen no evidence of Trump's accusation that he was wiretapped last year by his predecessor. ""We have not seen any evidence that there was a wiretap or a (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court order against Trump Tower or somebody in Trump Tower,"" Ryan said in an interview Thursday on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" with Wolf Blitzer. Rep. Charlie Dent also called Trump's unverified claim ""inexplicable."" ""That's inexplicable,"" the Pennsylvania Republican said Friday. ""Apparently there is no evidence of proof or any basis in fact so I think you should simply retract it."" Although White House press secretary Sean Spicer read an extensive litany of news reports from the podium Thursday that showed intelligence agencies' interest in Trump's activities, none of them actually corroborated Trump's claim.

"WashingtonBarack Obama's post-presidency life is way more glamorous than you could imagine. Back in Washington, President Donald Trump continues to suggest, without proof, that Obama wiretapped him and Republicans are busy trying to dismantle his signature health reform law. Nevertheless, former President Barack Obama is unwinding nicely from the most important job in the world.  He's been to sunny California for some golf, a private island in the Caribbean, where he kite-surfed with billionaire Richard Branson; he went to New York to take in a Broadway play, and then again, to dine with U2's Bono.   He lunched in Omaha last week with Warren Buffett and then hopped a flight to California, and then on to Hawaii (more golf). And today, Obama may be sitting pretty, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, on a tiny French Polynesian island called Tetiaroa. There are reports, unconfirmed by CNN, that Obama is going to spend a month on the island, which is north of Tahiti and features only one luxury hotel, aptly named ""The Brando"" because the Island was once owned by Marlon Brando. The eco-friendly hotel has one-, two- and three-bedroom villas, according to its website. It's been a favorite destination for more current celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio. Prices range from $2,000 per night, depending on accommodations and date. Their Instagram feed makes the place look quite nice.   An Obama spokesman tells CNN that the former president is now a private citizen and his schedule, therefore, is also private. Whether or not life after the White House includes an island respite, it also likely now includes writing a book. Penguin Random House last month announced it had won the bidding for memoirs from both Barack and Michelle Obama, a deal that could net the former first couple tens of millions of dollars.  The announcement also indicated the Obamas would donate a ""significant portion"" of that money to charities, including the Obama Foundation. When not on vacation, the Obamas are living in Washington; they've moved into a posh $5.3 million home in the Kalorama neighborhood of Northwest DC. They intend to stay until their younger daughter, Sasha, graduates high school in 2019. Older daughter, Malia,18, is taking a gap year and scheduled to attend Harvard University this fall. "

When not on vacation, the Obamas are living in Washington; they've moved into a posh $5.3 million home in the Kalorama neighborhood of Northwest DC. They intend to stay until their younger daughter, Sasha, graduates high school in 2019. Older daughter, Malia,18, is taking a gap year and scheduled to attend Harvard University this fall. "
" (CNN)A Republican lawmaker called on President Donald Trump Friday to either provide evidence or apologize to former President Barack Obama for his so-far unverified claim that Trump Tower was wiretapped during the 2016 election. ""I see no indication that that's true and so it's not a charge I would have ever made. And frankly, unless you can produce some pretty compelling proof, then I think that President Obama is owed an apology in that regard,"" Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole said. ""If he didn't do it, (Trump) shouldn't be reckless in accusations that he did,"" he added. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman and the ranking Democrat on the committee said Thursday that they've seen no evidence of Trump's accusation that he was wiretapped last year by his predecessor. ""We have not seen any evidence that there was a wiretap or a (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court order against Trump Tower or somebody in Trump Tower,"" Ryan said in an interview Thursday on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" with Wolf Blitzer. Rep. Charlie Dent also called Trump's unverified claim ""inexplicable."" ""That's inexplicable,"" the Pennsylvania Republican said Friday. ""Apparently there is no evidence of proof or any basis in fact so I think you should simply retract it."" Although White House press secretary Sean Spicer read an extensive litany of news reports from the podium Thursday that showed intelligence agencies' interest in Trump's activities, none of them actually corroborated Trump's claim. Despite that, Spicer said Trump is standing by his original tweets. ""He stands by it,"" Spicer said, characterizing the Senate Intelligence Committee's statement as not final. ""They have yet to go through the information."" This story has been updated. "
