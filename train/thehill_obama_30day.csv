Obama appointees transformed Justice into a 19th-Century political machine that coerced, bullied, and eschewed law for the altar of partisan politics. Shedding light on the systemic abuses that marred so many Department priorities and policies would be welcome. Both Obama AGs’ Loretta Lynch and Eric HolderEric H. HolderTop Dems prep for future while out of the spotlight Pavlich: Failure of Fast and Furious Special prosecutor should probe lawless Obama-era DOJ MORE put politics before law. Lynch made news for her tarmac gabfest with Bill ClintonBill ClintonSenate Democrats should grill Judge Gorsuch on antitrust. Here's how. Trump considering Conway's husband to head civil division at Justice: report The man and the machine: How Trump wields Twitter as his greatest political weapon MORE days before the FBI finished its probe of his wife, the Democrat presidential nominee. More recently, Lynch endorsed bloody street clashes to protect American rights. That’s not how it works. The Constitution, interpreted by the Courts, has always determined our rights, even in the Civil Rights era. Power through street brawls is the stuff of left-wing romanticism.    Holder’s DOJ “leadership” earned him a Congressional contempt charge but praise from his boss. It also set the Department’s new ethos: rules don’t matter, progressive politics does. Subordinates got the message, nowhere more than Texas. Civil Rights Division attorneys and local offices habitually acted unethically and unprofessionally while fighting the Lone Star State. One Texas federal judge was so shocked by federal lawyers’ repeated lies he ordered a blistering five-part remedy that would supervise ethics training for hundreds of Justice lawyers. He eventually withdrew much of the sanction but still called the government’s behavior “nothing short of stunning.” He further noted the 132 ethical violations DOJ has admitted just in the past four years would leave a private firm “deeply ashamed, out of business or both.” DOJ conduct similarly appalled a different judge in a redistricting case. He stated DOJ entered the case with “arrogance and condescension.” The eye-rolling, bubble-gum chewing attorneys, he believed, viewed Texas’ arguments as unworthy and its lawyers as “a bunch of backwoods hayseed bigots who bemoan the abolition of the poll tax and pine for the days of literacy tests and lynchings.” DOJ’s interest in Texas wasn’t random. Turning the red-state behemoth blue would ensure Democrat national political domination. When a 2013 Supreme Court case removed federal supervision of Texas’ election laws, Holder spared no taxpayer expense to get the state back under his thumb. DOJ has spent years and untold loot for this nakedly political goal. And it’s just part of the story. DOJ also circumvented Citizens United, another Supreme Court case Democrats despised. The Tea Party scandal — a direct result of the ruling — broke at the IRS but Justice played its part. Just before the 2010 midterms, Lois Lerner gave DOJ confidential donor information from conservative nonprofits without a court order. The only purpose for this illegal transfer was potential dirt on the president’s enemies, although no one acted before the scandal broke. Elsewhere DOJ shook down corporations to fund their nonprofit allies. Instead of the Treasury getting settlement money, DOJ asked corporate wrongdoers to “voluntarily” provide massive checks to their friends without covenants on how they spent the money. So far, this program has robbed the American taxpayer of at least $3 billion. In turn, these nonprofits support DOJ litigation and media efforts and provide fertile ground for future hires. And the beat goes on. AGs set the activist agenda and example by flaunting the law, subordinates work the trenches in partisan litigation while belittling adversaries, officials ignore the Supreme Court, and Justice strong arms corporations to fund outside allies, then hires them. Congressional Democrats cover the charade branding any oversight as witch-hunts or racism. Political appointees wait out the Republican administration by “burrowing” into the civil service, returning to the nonprofits, or just ending the pretense. It’s no coincidence the DNC chief formerly led DOJ’s Civil Rights Division. Problems at Justice didn’t begin with Obama. Both Clinton and Bush had issues. But the Obama DOJ professionalized lawlessness to an unseen degree. The Department’s politicization under Lynch and especially Holder is dark stain on Justice’s storied history. A special prosecutor could begin to restore confidence in this important institution. Paul Jossey is a campaign finance lawyer in Alexandria, Virginia. Follow him on Twitter at @paulhjossey.

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a peace deal during a secret meeting orchestrated by then-Secretary of State John KerryJohn KerryOne year ago today we declared ISIS atrocities as genocide Trump’s realism toward Iran is stabilizing force for Middle East 134 foreign policy experts condemn Trump travel ban MORE last February that sought to move toward ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to an AP report on Sunday.  Netanyahu participated in this secret meeting on Feb. 21, 2016 in Aqaba, Jordan, with King Abdullah II of Jordan and President el-Sissi of Egypt, former U.S. officials told the AP. Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, first reported the meeting. According to the AP, Kerry proposed renewed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in exchange for regional recognition that Israel is a Jewish state, which would’ve included peace with dozens of Muslim and Arab nations.  Netanyahu, who has long sought for Israeli to be recognized regionally, turned down the offer because he would have to pull out from territories seized in the 1967 Mideast war, which are now occupied by Israelis.  The arrangement reportedly also would have called for recognition of Jerusalem as a shared capital for Israelis and Palestinians and softer language on the ""right to return"" for Palestinian refugees who lost properties in what is now Israel. The officials speaking to the AP saw this deal as a way of “updating” but not “superseding” the 2002 Arab initiative. The proposal was apparently positively received by Egyptian and Jordanian leaders, but Netanyahu would not commit to it. Netanyahu declined the offer, citing lack of support in his hard-line nationalist government as the primary reason, the AP reports. An official told the AP that it appeared Netanyahu would only offer vague steps to build confidence and was more interested in meeting Abbas and some Arab leaders. While Netanyahu turned down the deal, it is not clear whether the Arab states would’ve accepted or declined the deal either. They “showed varying degrees of the enthusiasm,” with the Palestinians expressing the most concern about the concessions the deal would require. Netanyahu did not comment on the newspaper report. 4The news comes shortly after Netanyahu — who had a cool relationship with President Obama — came to Washington to visit with President Trump and other top officials. "
"A group of voters in France is urging former President Obama to run in the French presidential election this spring. “At a time when France is about to vote massively for the extreme right, we can still give a lesson of democracy to the planet by electing a French President, a foreigner,” the French website for “OBAMA17” reads, ABC News first reported on Thursday. ""[It’s] because he has the best resume in the world,” the site, which is not connected with Obama, continues.  The group is jockeying for 1 million signatures, even though Obama is not French and France requires its presidential candidates to be natives. “We started dreaming about this idea two months before the end of Obama’s presidency,” an OBAMA17 spokesman told ABC. ""We dreamed about this possibility to vote for someone we really admire, someone who could lead us to project ourselves in a bright future."" “Then, we thought, whether it’s possible or not, whether or not he is French, we have to do this for real, to give French people hope … Vive la Republique, Vive Obama, Vive la France and the U.S.A.”"
"Welcome to Overnight Regulation, your daily news from the federal agencies, Capitol Hill the courts and beyond. It's Tuesday evening here in Washington where Republicans are pushing their plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Here's what you need to know.    THE BIG STORY  Some House Democrats have repeatedly voted to overturn regulations that were issued under President Obama, breaking with their party. At least one Democrat has voted for 13 of the last 14 resolutions passed by the House under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a tool that gives Republicans the power to cancel regulations issued in the final months of the Obama administration. Republicans found the greatest Democratic support in their vote to roll back a rule that made it harder for people with mental illnesses to buy a gun. Six Democrats backed that measure, which canceled a requirement that the Social Security Administration report people who receive disability benefits and have a mental health condition to the FBI's background check system. A few Democrats also broke ranks on votes to eliminate the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council's so-called blacklisting rule, end the Interior Department's stream protection rule and cancel a Health and Human Services regulation that prevented states from withholding funds for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood. Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.), a longtime opponent of abortion rights, voted against Obama's Planned Parenthood rule, saying he wanted to return funding decisions to the states. ""It's certainly not something that I support,"" Lipinski told The Hill. ""The states should have the ability to decide if they're going to not direct funding to organizations that provide abortions."" Lipinski also joined the Republicans in voting to overturn a rule limiting the power of states to require drug tests for receiving federal unemployment benefits. Encouraging drug tests, Lipinski said, would both help government officials identify addicts and incentivize users to ""get cleaned up."" ""I know there's a lot of disagreement over this on my side,"" Lipinski said. ""[But] we have a big drug-addiction problem right now, and maybe this is the way to help people get the help that they need."" For the lawmakers who bucked their party on the votes, the political fallout will almost certainly be negligible. That's because almost all of those rogue lawmakers are either Capitol Hill veterans, safely seated in districts where serious challenges are rare and reelection is all but assured, or they represent regions where defying their party on regulatory issues will play well with voters. Lipinski, now in his seventh term, said he's heard no criticism from constituents over the votes but did get ""the usual"" grief from Democrats defending Obama's legacy. ""Obviously, out here [in Washington], both sides stick with the party,"" he said. Lipinski won reelection overwhelmingly in 2014, with 65 percent of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2016, though he could be a GOP target in 2018. Rep. Henry Cuellar (Texas) voted affirmatively on 10 of the 14 resolutions, more than any other Democrat. ""Anybody that gets up here to vote with the party is doing a disservice to the public. I come up here to do what I think is right,"" he said. ""If I agree with the Democrats as a Democrat, I'll do it, but if I disagree, I will disagree."" Cuellar said he's been voting this way for the last 12 years and doesn't fear any political fallout. Like Lipinski, he won reelection with a comfortable margin -- 66 percent to 31 percent -- in a district where Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonHalperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' Republicans take heat on Trump's tax returns Trump: Elizabeth Warren running against me would be 'a dream'  MORE prevailed in the presidential election in November. ""Are all the protections gone? Of course not,"" he said. ""The ones I feel are unnecessary, of course, I'm going to vote against. It doesn't mean that if you vote against that rule every protection for water or every protection for workers is gone."" Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) was next in line, voting for seven of the 14 resolutions. He supported overturning the rule prohibiting the coal industry from polluting streams near mines, the rule requiring energy companies to disclose the payments they make to foreign governments and the rule creating protections for Alaskan bears and other predators. He also voted to remove restrictions on state drug testing for unemployment benefits and the rule barring states from withholding money for abortion providers. ""I'm 100 percent pro-life. Why wouldn't I vote that way?"" he asked. Peterson noted that he was behind efforts in the mid-1990s to pass the CRA. ""We were trying to rein in regulations back then,"" he said. ""We have given these agencies way more power than they should have. They have more power to legislate than we do."" Peterson hails from a rural Minnesota district that favored President Trump by a whopping 62 percent to 31 percent -- Trump's largest margin in a district where the Democrat won the House race. Given the region's conservative tilt, Peterson's votes to gut Obama-era regulations will likely prove a credit, not a liability, in the eyes of voters, who handed Peterson his 14th term by a slim margin of 53 percent to 47 percent. Though a GOP target in 2018, Peterson said he's not at all concerned about his voting record hurting his chances for reelection. ""I've been doing this for 27 years,"" he said. ""It's not any surprise to my constituents."" Many of the CRA resolutions have yet to pass the Senate. Trump has signed three of them so far.

"The auto manufacturers’ lobby is pushing the new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) head to withdraw an Obama administration decision locking in strict vehicle emissions standards. The Auto Alliance argued in a letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt released Wednesday that the Obama administration acted improperly when it decided last month that the greenhouse gas emissions standards plan set in 2012 can go forward through 2025. The Auto Alliance wrote that the January decision “may be the single most important decision that EPA has made in recent history,” and asked that it be reversed “to remedy the severe procedural and substantive defects that have infected the process to date.”  In his January confirmation hearing, he promised that he would “review” the Obama administration’s decision for potential changes. And President Trump promised last month in a meeting with automaker executives that he would reduce regulations that affect the industry. Automakers have long complained that the 2012 standards on emissions and related standards on fuel economy are too strong and would be too costly to keep implementing for both for companies and consumers. They are asking the Trump administration to weaken them. The plan envisions an average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The Auto Alliance said it only agreed to the aggressive 2012 plan under the condition that the federal government undertake a thorough review in 2018 into whether those standards are still appropriate. The association told Pruitt that the EPA rushed the review to get it out before Obama left office, and asked him to reopen it. “We urge EPA to reconsider imposing such a far-reaching mandate on an entire industry without adequately considering the consequences, and without giving stakeholders and meaningful opportunity to comment,” the auto group said. Environmental and consumer groups have applauded the existing regulations, saying they save consumers money while cutting down on harmful emissions. Since the 2012 regulations were previously made final, any attempt to change them would require a comprehensive regulatory process."

Obama’s departure from 160 Fifth Ave. attracted a large crowd, according to footage first reported by Business Insider. The video shows Obama receiving raucous applause and cheers as he walks to a motorcade of at least three black cars.  Business Insider said Obama’s foundation did not respond to a request for comment about the former president’s visit, and it is unclear why he was in New York City from the video. Obama has mostly kept a low profile since exiting the White House last month after two terms as president.

The Democrat then placed 12th in C-SPAN’s 2017 presidential historians survey last week, which was conducted among 91 historians and other executive branch experts. Participants were told to give presidents a score of 1 to 10 on different “qualities of presidential leadership.""

"President Trump is facing pressure to roll back union-friendly policy changes made by the Obama-era National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Workforce Freedom Initiative (WFI) published a report Monday that raises concerns about the “worst” NLRB policies issued during the Obama administration. The list includes policies that hold companies accountable for labor violations committed by their partners, speed up union elections, and allow small groups of workers to organize multiple unions inside a single company. The NLRB is an independent agency that does not answer directly to the president, but Trump holds considerable sway, because he is preparing to nominate two Republicans to fill vacant seats on the five-member board. This would give the NLRB a GOP majority and allow it to reverse many Obama-era labor policies that Republicans have long opposed. But thwarting these labor policies could upset many of the working-class voters who helped elect Trump last November. Here’s a look at some of the Chamber’s top priorities for the NLRB: Micro-unions have come under scrutiny from business groups. In the NLRB’s 2011 Specialty Healthcare decision, the board ruled that small groups of workers can organize, even if the majority of employees across the company do not wish to form a union. This opened the door for multiple “micro-unions” to take shape inside a single company. “In essence, unions can now gerrymander the bargaining units they wish to organize,” the Chamber writes in the report. “Smaller groups of employees are typically easier to organize.” Union elections The NLRB took the rare step of issuing a regulation that speeds up union elections in December 2014. Critics refer to it as the “ambush election” rule. The process of organizing a union dropped from an average of 42 days after petition is filed to as few as 10 days, according to the Chamber. Labor groups claimed companies would use the additional time to intimidate workers against organizing. But businesses say the new rule does not give them enough time to respond to their employees as they consider whether to unionize. Joint employer The Chamber also raised concerns about the NLRB’s joint employer policy. The joint employer policy makes companies vulnerable for workplace violations committed by their business partners. This is a particular concern for the restaurant industry and staffing agencies. “The franchising industry is an obvious target of the new standard,” the Chamber wrote. The Chamber also called on the NLRB to dump Obama-era policies that expanded workers’ picketing rights, limited arbitration clauses in employee contracts, and allowed employees to use their company email addresses to send union-released messages."
"President Trump signed an order Tuesday directing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to formally reconsider former President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaSpicer slams media for coverage of Russia, wiretapping claims Ex-intelligence official: Napolitano’s British wiretapping claim ‘didn’t get it right’ Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' MORE’s Clean Water Rule. The executive order is an opening shot by Trump against the EPA, which was a frequent target of criticism from Republicans for alleged overreach under Obama’s tenure. It’s the first step toward repealing the 2015 water rule, which asserted federal power over small waterways like wetlands and streams for the purposes of controlling pollution under the Clean Water Act. Trump promised on the campaign trail to repeal the regulation. “It’s a horrible, horrible rule. Has sort of a nice name, but everything else is bad,” Trump said at a White House signing ceremony, surrounded by Vice President Pence, first lady Melania Trump and top opponents of the regulation, including newly installed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Sen. Jim InhofeJames InhofeGOP senator: EPA 'brainwashing our kids' A guide to the committees: Senate GOP considers ways to ‘modernize’ endangered species law MORE (R-Okla.), Sen.

Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio.).   “The Clean Water Act says that the EPA can regulate navigable waters, meaning waters that truly affect interstate commerce. But a few years ago, the EPA decided that navigable waters can mean nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmer’s land, or any place else that they decide,” Trump said before signing the order. “It was a massive power grab. The EPA’s regulators are putting people out of jobs by the hundreds of thousands.” The rule, also known as Waters of the United States, is currently on hold, blocked by the Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit due to litigation against it. Since the rule is already on hold, Trump’s order doesn’t change much immediately. It does not repeal the rule, instead directing the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to consider rolling it back, a process likely to take years. Trump’s order also asks the agencies to take into account what late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in 2006, describing a far more limited jurisdiction for the federal government over waterways, a senior administration official told reporters Monday. The White House has not released the text of the order. Opponents of the rule have long tried to kill the water rule through the courts or legislative means. They say its definitions are so expansive that it could give the federal government authority over puddles, dry areas and farming ditches. The rule’s supporters criticized Trump’s action. Gina McCarthyGina McCarthyEPA chief: ‘Help is on the way’ for farmers Trump moves to kill Obama water rule Obama EPA chief: Pruitt must uphold ‘law and science’ MORE, EPA chief under Obama from 2013 to earlier this year, slammed Trump’s action. “An executive order may give the illusion they’re fulfilling a campaign promise to gut the EPA, but it doesn't ‘trump’ a rule,” said McCarthy, one of the main architects of the regulation. The order just “continues to deny 117 million people in the U.S. of the comfort of knowing the waters they rely on for drinking water are not being protected,” she continued. “Instead of protecting the things we hold dear like our tap water, our rivers or our health, President Trump is, once again, protecting big polluters,” said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The Clean Water Rule’s safeguards are grounded in science and law,” she said. “The rule was developed over many years, after more than 1 million public comments.” “President Trump is doing a tremendous service for landowners across the country by instructing his administration to repeal of the Obama-era WOTUS regulation,” said Tom Pyle, a Trump ally and head of the conservative Institute for Energy Research. “The rule was never about protecting water. It was designed to expand the federal government's reach into management decisions on state and private lands,” he said. “Far from attacking clean water, today's decision begins the process of returning power to states, local communities and property owners.” This story was updated at 3:07 p.m."
"The cost of protecting President Trump's family is on track to far outstrip that of his predecessor, according to estimates. According to estimates by the Washington Post, the expenses of the first four weeks of Trump's presidency suggest that the U.S. government may end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars more that it did on the Obamas, largely because of extensive travel.According to the estimate, Trump's three trips to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida since the inauguration cost approximately $10 million in travel, security and more."
"New Education Secretary Betsy DeVos defended the Trump administration’s decision to rescind protections for transgender students, arguing that the protections were an “overreach” of the Obama administration. Her comments come a day after the Trump administration rolled back protections for transgender students established by the Obama administration. The Obama-era directive allowed children to use school bathrooms and other facilities that correspond with their gender identities.  “This issue was a very huge example of the Obama administration's overreach, to suggest one-size-fits-all, federal government approach,” DeVos said on Thursday at the conservative conference CPAC.   At CPAC, Trump’s Education secretary largely reiterated her statement released on Wednesday, saying that she’s committed to protecting all students. The new guidance includes language directing schools to crack down on the bullying of transgender students. “I have made it clear from the moment I’ve been in this job that it’s our job to protect students and to do that to the fullest extent we can,” DeVos continued, adding that she wants “to provide students, parents and teachers with more flexibility around how education is delivered.” “The role of the federal government should be as light a touch as possible.” —Mark Hensch contributed."

"The Labor Department announced Wednesday that it is delaying a long-awaited rule that the Obama administration finished in January to protect workers from a dangerous element known as beryllium. The rule — former President Obama’s last major workplace protection — set to take effect March 21 will now be pushed back until May 20 as a result of the regulatory freeze President Trump initiated when he took office. Beryllium is a lightweight metal that’s used in foundry and smelting operations, machining, beryllium oxide ceramics, composites manufacturing and dental lab work. When sanded down, the dust particles carry severe health risks when inhaled, including cancer risks.  It also set a short-term exposure limit of 2.0 micrograms per cubic meter of air over a 15-minute sampling period. OSHA said the delay gives the agency an opportunity for further review and consideration of the rule. Hours after January's inauguration, Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, issued a memo ordering agencies to halt all regulatory action. He called for any rules that had been finalized, but had not yet taken effect, to be delayed for at least 60 days. OSHA is accepting public comment through March 12 on whether to delay the rule even further."

"Transgender students in New York won't lose any protections created under Obama-era regulations, despite the Trump administration's roll-back of the policy Wednesday night, a spokesperson for the state’s attorney general said. “If President Trump withdraws Obama administration’s guidance, transgender students will still be protected by Title IX and its implementing regulations, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex,” said Amy Spitalnick, a spokesperson for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D). “Additionally, our state law protections are independent from federal law — for example, the Dignity of All Students Act.” “The Attorney General will continue to ensure that Title IX and New York’s own civil rights protections are enforced, because we know that policies that ensure equality for transgender New Yorkers promote safe and inclusive schools, workplaces, and communities — benefiting everyone,” the statement concludes.  The guidelines allow for children at public schools to use bathrooms and other facilities based on their gender identities. Citing the need to consider the legal issues of the regulations, the Department of Justice and Department of Education released new guidance withdrawing the policies on Wednesday evening."
"Top lawyers from former President Obama’s administration are launching a group aimed at keeping President Trump from breaking ethics rules. United to Protect Democracy has already built a $1.5 million operating budget and hired five staffers, a number it expects to double soon, Politico reported Thursday. “When people hear concerns about democracies declining into authoritarianism, they expect that moment to come in a singular thunderclap where everyone can see that this is the time,” said Ian Bassin, the organization's leader.  The group is incorporated both as a 501(c)(3) and a 501(c)(4), meaning it can operate as a nonprofit while also engaging in limited political advocacy. United to Protect Democracy will focus on issues such as Trump administration officials potentially intervening in regulatory agencies or intimidating staff. The organization has already submitted 50 Freedom of Information Act requests regarding ethics in the Trump administration. White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded to the group’s formation by waving off any potential ethics concerns. “This administration has raised the level of ethics training and oversight to a new level compared to the practices of the previous administration,” he told Politico."

During the campaign, President Trump often said he would undo much Obama’s climate work, and Pruitt is expected to help him do so. Shortly after she left the EPA at the end of Obama’s term, McCarthy said she hadn’t met with Pruitt to discuss his plans for running the agency. The Senate confirmed Pruitt on a 52-46 vote on Friday. Only two Democrats supported his nomination, and one Republican opposed him.       “The need for clean air, water and land does not go out of style and is not limited to any one party,” McCarthy said in her statement. “My hope is when Mr. Pruitt heads to EPA, he fully understands the grave responsibility of the agency he now leads and upholds it remarkably important and timeless work.”"

The CIO authorized none of the 18 information technology systems, as 18F was required to do. 18F granted itself “pre-authorization” of systems it deemed to be low risk “without completing any security assessment and authorization process.”  The report notes that 18F also improperly replaced GSA-hired staff.  “We also found that the 18F Director of Infrastructure appointed himself as the 18F Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) when he became dissatisfied with the ISSOs GSA IT assigned to 18F,” reads the report.  “According to GSA policy, the Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for appointing ISSOs, who are responsible, among other things, for implementing and enforcing GSA’s Information Technology Security Policy.”"
"In 2014, the Justice Department settled two cases stemming from the financial crisis against Bank of America and Citigroup worth a combined $23.7 billion, $9.5 billion of which was supposed to go to so-called consumer relief. Shockingly, two of the big winners were the National Council of La Raza and the National Urban League which each scored more than a million dollars from the settlement. Under the Obama Administration agreements, a good chunk of the massive cash awards ended up being given to third party activist groups as part of the settlement.  This diverted millions of dollars away from the supposed victims in the mortgage settlement cases, which they presumably should have been entitled to receive under the terms of the settlement. In the Bank of America settlement alone, $84 million of donations to third party groups wiped out $194 million off the consumer relief portion of the tab, according the June 2016 report by the Washington Examiner’s Sean Higgins. Even though these third-party groups were not harmed at all, Obama’s Justice Department made certain some of their major supporters palms were greased with La Raza getting a $1.5 million payout just for being a friend of the President. And make no mistake, it was not the punitive payout to the federal government that was impacted, but instead the payout to the identified victims of the mortgage crisis whose fund was raided on behalf of the politically connected “public interest groups.” Legal proceedings by the government must never be used as shakedowns to enrich the coffers of any political cause, regardless of ideology.

The bill bars the government from “directing or providing for a payment to any person or entity other than the United States, other than a payment that provides restitution for or otherwise directly remedies actual harm (including to the environment) directly and proximately caused by the party making the payment, or constitutes payment for services rendered in connection with the case…” In an emailed statement to Americans for Limited Government, Goodlatte explained the legislation, writing, “This bill is oversight and action.

"President Trump will order the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday to formally review former President Obama’s Clean Water Rule, kicking off the process of eliminating or significantly changing the rule. The executive order is the first step toward fulfilling one of Trump’s key campaign promises, repealing a regulation that’s been a top target for Republicans and numerous business interests. It is also the first regulatory action he has taken specific to the EPA, with more actions likely to come to roll back Obama’s aggressive environmental agenda.  A senior administration official told reporters Monday that the order would not rescind the waterways rule, because that has to be done through a formal regulatory process. Instead, the order will instruct the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to formally reconsider the rule, which could lead to its repeal or a significant rewrite. The official said Trump can’t legally prejudge the outcome of the rulemaking process, which could take well over a year to complete. The 2015 regulation, also known as Waters of the United States, asserts federal power over small waterways such as wetlands, headwaters and ponds, requiring Clean Water Act permits for any actions that could harm or pollute them. The Obama administration said 117 million Americans’ drinking water relies on those waterways. The rule is currently on hold. The Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, based in Cincinnati, ordered it halted in 2015 while numerous lawsuits challenging the rule wind their ways through the court system.  Scott Pruitt, the current EPA head and former attorney general of Oklahoma, led one of the lawsuits. To Republicans and industries such as agriculture, developers and energy companies, the rule would have added a major new burden by requiring costly permits for numerous land uses. Opponents say its definitions are so broad that puddles could be put under federal control. “The problem with the Obama administration’s [Waters of the United States] rule is that it vastly expands federal jurisdiction into state and local areas of land use,” the administration official said. “It vastly expands federal jurisdiction over state waters and we think, in looking at it, it could potentially violate the Supreme Court decisions.” The order specifically asks the agencies to consider what the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the 2006 case Rapanos v. United States, saying the Clean Water Act ought only to cover navigable waters and waterways “with a continuous surface connection” to them — a far more restrictive definition than what the Obama EPA put into its rule. The official said the EPA will also be instructed to ask the 6th Circuit court to put the litigation against it on hold while the administration reviews it."
"There is no federal law that requires any educational institution to refrain from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. There are only federal laws that require institutions to refrain from discriminating on the basis of sex. Like it or not, that is a fact. The Obama administration decided that it would be a good thing if schools that receive federal funding accommodated transgendered students by permitting them to use bathrooms and locker-rooms that aligned with their own subjective sexual orientation. Having made that decision, there were two ways the Obama administration could have proceeded to achieve that goal. One way would have been to candidly announce that the current legal framework did not permit the federal government to impose such a requirement on schools.  And a legitimate part of Obama’s legacy would have been the commencement of an honest debate about how transgendered people should be treated. A second way to proceed would be to pretend that the administration had power it actually did not have under the law. The Obama administration chose the second way: it pretended that statutes that prohibit discrimination based on sex were equivalent to (non-existent) statutes that would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Obama administration prided itself on paying close attention to the teachings of science, and it mocked those who were not sufficiently attentive to science. Yet, that same administration chose to accept the view that, if an individual subjectively feels very strongly that his or her gender identity is at variance with fully functional sex organs, that very strong subjective feeling would change the individual’s sex. I don’t believe serious students of the science of human reproductive biology would accept any such proposition. But the Obama administration was willing to accept that proposition, and now Trump administration has decided to call a halt to what has been, at best, a charade. Of course, the new administration did not have to rescind the Obama administration’s edicts regarding transgendered students. It’s a safe bet that, if Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonHalperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' Republicans take heat on Trump's tax returns Trump: Elizabeth Warren running against me would be 'a dream'  MORE had been elected, her administration would have left those regulations in place. Still, no matter who won the White House, the Obama regulations would continue to lack any adequate legal foundation. So, the new administration refuses to continue with the charade, and, very predictably, Pres. Trump is portrayed in many venues as the bad guy in the drama. But, before jumping on the bandwagon of condemnation, it might be worthwhile to stop and consider all—not just some—of the issues that are at stake. Transgendered students and their supporters believe that it is important that they be accommodated in accordance with their subjective sexual orientation. That is a given, and they are of course entitled to those very strong opinions. But there are other people who have different views, and they too are entitled to their opinions. Even those who feel most strongly on either side of this issue ought to appreciate that it makes a difference how we, as a society, come to decide how transgendered people should be treated. If we want to live in a society where transgendered students must be accommodated, it should be obvious that we must decide as a society that that is what we want. And the way we decide that kind of thing as a society is to have our elected representatives pass legislation that codifies such accommodations into law. If there is not enough political support now to win such accommodations, then those who favor them have to labor in the political vineyards until sufficient support has been created. That is how democracy works. It is a kind of cheating to rely on a particular administration’s regulations or guidance to accomplish that end, when the law does not give that administration, or any administration, the legal power to issue such regulations. That kind of cheating might, for a time, accomplish its end. But, if a new administration decides to play the game by the rules, the cheating will end very abruptly. Now, what we have is a mess. Recriminations will abound; town hall meetings will be disrupted; feelings will be hurt; names will be called; resistance will be fierce. And the plain fact is that the mess is the fault of Obama. In this area, as in so many others, Obama thought it would be a terrific idea to pretend to have greater legal authority than he actually had. As a result, the hopes of millions of people were falsely raised by the misleading illusion of presidential authority; those hopes were dashed when there was a change of administration. Perhaps that’s what Obama was referring to when he ran on the slogan of “Hope and Change.” David E. Weisberg is an attorney, and a member of the New York state bar.

"The Trump administration is seeking to delay an Obama-era rule on investment advisers that is fiercely opposed by the financial industry. The Labor Department proposed Wednesday to delay implementation of the so-called fiduciary rule, which broadly requires retirement advisers to act in the best interest of their clients. The regulation, supported by liberals on Capitol Hill such as Sen. Elizabeth WarrenElizabeth WarrenTrump: Elizabeth Warren running against me would be 'a dream'  Senate Dems introduce bill to rescind Trump border wall, immigration order  Chelsea Clinton plans new children's book: 'She Persisted' MORE (D-Mass.), is aimed at preventing conflicts of interest where financial advisers push clients toward investment products that they receive commissions for. But critics in the business world say the rule is overly broad and will have disastrous consequences, cutting off investment advice to people with lower incomes.  “FSR believes a best-interest standard should be implemented for all investment accounts and that financial professionals should act in the ‘best interest’ of their customers,” Pawlenty said. “But such a requirement should be implemented without miles of bureaucratic red tape."" President Trump last month ordered the Labor Department to review the fiduciary rule to determine whether it would “adversely affect the ability of Americans to gain access to retirement information and financial advice” or whether the rule could result in an increase in lawsuits against financial advisers. The Labor Department responded Wednesday by proposing to delay the implementation of the fiduciary rule from April until June, which will give the Trump administration more time to repeal the regulation. ""Absent an extension of the applicability date, if the examination prompts the Department to propose rescinding or revising the rule, affected advisers, retirement investors and other stakeholders might face two major changes in the regulatory environment rather than one,"" the Labor Department said in the proposal. ""This could unnecessarily disrupt the marketplace, producing frictional costs that are not offset by commensurate benefits."" Some financial firms, such as Merrill Lynch, have announced that they would begin complying with the Obama-era fiduciary rule regardless of what the Trump administration does. Republican lawmakers voted to overturn the fiduciary rule last year under the Congressional Review Act, but President Obama vetoed that measure.  Due to that, Trump’s Labor Department would have to go through an entirely new rulemaking process to repeal the fiduciary rule, a process that could take months to complete. Proponents of the fiduciary rule have tried to change the White House's mind. In February, several groups met with the White House, urging officials not to stop the regulation. In 10 separate meetings, roughly a dozen organizations pushed to have the regulation take effect, including the AFL-CIO, AARP, Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, Consumer Federation of America, American Association for Justice, Center for American Progress and Better Markets.  ""The courts have repeatedly held that any delay in the rule would cause far more harm on the public than it would to the industry that's complaining about the rule,"" Stephen Hall, the legal director for Better Markets, told The Hill. Industry groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the FSR, the Insured Retirement Institute, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, have sued the Labor Department over the rule, arguing it could have negative, unattended consequences and raise the price of investment advice.  The rule has so far survived four different court challenges. Proponents of the fiduciary standard say they will fight to protect it. ""We will absolutely consider all of our options in protecting and defending this rule. If we deem it appropriate and necessary to take legal action, we would certainly consider it,"" Hall said. So far, Trump's Justice Department has been defending the rule against industry lawsuits. Changing course on the legal battlefield may not be looked upon kindly by judges, legal experts say. During the consideration of the rule under the Obama administration, industry lobbyists also met with the White House to press for curtailing the regulation.  In the early months of 2016, there were 17 meetings about the rule, both for its proponents and opponents, according to an analysis of records by The Hill.  Heavy hitters such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the FSR, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Investment Company Institute, the American Council of Life Insurers, and the Spark Institute, an industry group for the retirement plan industry, all attended White House meetings from January 2016 to March 2016.  “This is a topic of interest to virtually everyone in the [financial services] industry,” Michael Hadley, a partner at law firm Davis & Harman, who has attended recent meetings, told The Hill at the time. — This story was updated at 11:53 a.m."

Levin listed his reasoning and offered evidence, including saying his sources tell him “the FBI sought and was granted a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court” order. “This is spying.” Levin charged that the Obama administration began investigating Trump in October because of, or under the umbrella of, his connection to Russia. Levin also suggested that private emails were given to the Obama administration to review. “Quote, ‘The Guardian has learned the FBI applied for a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in court in order to monitor four members of the Trump team,’” Levin read from an article, adding, “Keep in mind, this is during presidential election.” Levin then suggested six agencies — including the FBI, CIA, NSA and Justice Department — knew about the Trump-Russia investigation that happened before the election. “The FBI and five law enforcement intelligent agencies have collaborated for months in an investigation in Russian attempts to influence the November election. … Are you telling me Barack ObamaBarack ObamaSpicer slams media for coverage of Russia, wiretapping claims Ex-intelligence official: Napolitano’s British wiretapping claim ‘didn’t get it right’ Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' MORE didn't know it was going on in six agencies?” Levin asked.

"President Trump ratcheted up his attacks on his predecessor Saturday, with his allegation that former President Obama ordered surveillance of the real estate mogul before the November election sparking confusion and backlash. Democrats slammed Trump for making the accusations without offering evidence, characterizing his early morning rant as an effort to distract from renewed scrutiny of his aides and allies' alleged ties to Russia. Taking to Twitter early in the morning, Trump fired off claims — without providing evidence — that Obama had wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower in New York to monitor his campaign’s communications. In the tweets, Trump compared the move to McCarthyism, the draconian hunt for communists in the U.S. government in the 1940s and '50s, and Richard Nixon’s ordered wiretapping in the 1970s Watergate scandal.  “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” he said in another. A spokesman for Obama denied the accusations, saying that no one in Obama's White House ordered the surveillance of Americans, let alone Trump. ""A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,"" spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement. At least two Republicans, Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Rep. Justin AmashJustin AmashRepublicans take heat on Trump's tax returns The Hill's 12:30 Report Freedom Caucus still opposes GOP healthcare plan MORE (Mich.), called on Trump to provide more information about his allegation. “We are in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public trust, and the President’s allegations today demand the thorough and dispassionate attention of serious patriots,"" Sasse said in a statement. Sasse noted any such wiretap would have taken place with authorization from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and ""an application for surveillance exists that the court found credible."" ""The president should ask that this full application regarding surveillance of foreign operatives or operations be made available, ideally to the full public, and at a bare minimum to the U.S. Senate,"" Sasse said. Former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes slammed Trump over the allegation, tweeting, ""No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) labeled Trump the “Deflector-In-Chief"" for his tweets, while former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Trump ""kicking up dust only adds to suspicions and the need for full public reckoning."" “Mr. President: If there was a wiretap at Trump Tower, that means a fed judge found probable cause of crime which means you are in deep sh--,” Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) wrote on Twitter. Trump’s allegations appeared to blindside officials in his own administration. A senior Trump official reportedly told NBC News on Saturday that neither he, nor other administration officials, seemed to know what the president was talking about. Observers speculated that Trump may have been reacting to a Breitbart News story published Friday. That story quoted conservative radio host Mark Levin alleging that the Obama administration used “police state” tactics to keep tabs on the real estate mogul’s presidential campaign. The article has been making rounds among Trump’s White House staff, according to The Washington Post. One White House official told the Post the Breitbart report provided a useful list for tracking alleged attempts by the Obama administration to undermine Trump. Republican Sen. Lindsey GrahamLindsey GrahamGraham keeping the heat on Trump's wiretapping claims US sends warning to North Korea — with China the likely audience What two GOP senators get right and dangerously wrong about Afghanistan MORE (S.C.) expressed unease about Trump’s remarks Saturday while also suggesting it would be troublesome if the Obama administration had a lawful reason to monitor Trump’s communications. “I’m very worried that our president is suggesting the former president has done something illegal,” Graham said at a town hall in Clemson, S.C. “I’d be very worried if in fact the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governments,” he continued. “It’s my job as United States senator to get to the bottom of this."" Trump's tweets Saturday represented a further souring of his relationship with his predecessor, after the pair described a warmer transition process following a bitter campaign. The wiretapping allegation followed Trump claiming last month that Obama was behind the wave of protests and government leaks that have marked the early days of his administration. Trump also argued in news conference last month that he ""inherited a mess"" from Obama, suggesting that his predecessor was responsible for foreign and domestic policy disasters and massive unemployment in the U.S. Trump's allegation Saturday invoking Watergate was punctuated with the president firing off a tweet needling actor Arnold Schwarzenegger's decision to quit as the host of ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" with Trump saying his successor on the show was ""fired"" by ratings. Trump also appeared slated to go golfing Saturday at his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, according to a pool report citing the White House press office. Trump’s young administration has been roiled by questions about his potential ties to Russia, and what role the Kremlin played in the 2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community concluded last year that Moscow ran an extensive influence campaign to help Trump’s presidential bid, while scrutiny of his team's contacts with Russian officials during the campaign and before he took office has mounted. The president’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned last month amid revelations that he misled Vice President Pence about his discussion of U.S. sanctions on Russia with Moscow's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, before Trump took office.

"President Trump early Tuesday incorrectly blamed the Obama administration for releasing 122 ""vicious"" prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. “122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!” Trump wrote.  “Former Gitmo detainee killed by a U.S. airstrike in Yemen; at least 122 former Gitmo detainees have re-engaged in terrorism” the “Fox & Friends” account tweeted just after 6:30 a.m. But according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 113 of the 122 former detainees who have re-engaged in terrorism were released before January 2009, when former President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaSpicer slams media for coverage of Russia, wiretapping claims Ex-intelligence official: Napolitano’s British wiretapping claim ‘didn’t get it right’ Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' MORE took office.

"Many of us can recall a moment when a political leader made a statement or comparison that caused us to grimace. In fact, there are moments in our very own lives when we have made a comment that we would later regret; it’s part of the human experience and none of us are perfect. However, words do matter and there are times when a poorly turned phrase, especially by a public figure, can be offensive to some. Expectations are higher, rightfully so. But one’s character is affirmed by how the person handles themselves in that controversy. Are they defensive or in a denial? Or do they listen, process and clarify to reflect the intended meaning of their words?    The outrage was immediate, but President Obama made similar comments during a ceremony for newly naturalized U.S. citizens on Dec. 15, 2015. Obama referred to ""those of African heritage who had not come here voluntarily,"" and said they were ""immigrants themselves"" in ""their own way"" who had faith they could create a better life for themselves. Yet, there was no backlash or calls for an apology. However, Dr. Cason, being a man of integrity, clarified his remarks: “The slave narrative and immigrant narrative are two entirely different experiences. Slaves were ripped from their families and their homes and forced against their will after being sold into slavery by slave traders. The immigrants made the choice to come to America. They saw this country as a land of opportunity. In contrast, slaves were forced here against their will and lost all of their opportunities.” I have known Dr. Carson for 25 years. His intent with his original comments was to shine a light on the values and aspirations that we share. It was certainly not to offend anyone. As he noted later, the slavery experience and the immigrant experience could not be more different. His own life, it’s challenges and obstacles and apparent limits have reflected the reality of growing up in inner-city poverty, the ancestor of slaves. Dr. Carson’s instinct is not to ignore the scars of the historical American black experience, but rather to find ways to unite all Americans because that is the best way forward. True, if given the opportunity, he would likely have phrased Monday’s remarks differently. But we should all look to Dr. Carson as a healing, unifying public figure and take his words in context. In their entirety, Dr. Carson told me, his remarks were well received by the career staff at HUD. He received a standing ovation and multiple rounds of applause. One woman even stood up, Dr. Carson told me, and said that his remarks have gave her comfort. He added that there were hundreds of staff waiting in line after the remarks to get a chance to shake his hand or take a quick picture with him. Yet, all of this was lost by the media reports. Based on his impression of the event, Dr. Carson said the staff wasn’t offended and one African-American male staffer told the secretary hours later that he didn’t even know anything Dr. Carson said was controversial until he saw it on the local news, which speaks volumes. Dr. Carson is a servant leader, a man of compassion, always putting others before himself. We can all get caught up in the moment and say things off script, but what matters is that we take the time to listen to those who may have been offended by our remarks and provide clarity, which is exactly what Dr. Carson has done. The department that Dr. Carson now leads faces major challenges and opportunities. He is uniquely positioned to bring together various federal departments to comprehensively address the needs of America’s most challenged families and communities. He can break down the artificial silos that have no regard of their interdependence. Leveraging his international reputation as a healthcare expert, Dr. Carson can lead efforts to use housing to improve health outcomes — reducing chronic illness such as asthma and other respiratory illnesses. He can create the incentives for a more public-private partnership that will provide better, stronger, healthier conditions for public housing residents. And he will push to use data and technology to give low-income residents more choice, more services, more support and more hope. These are the true issues that deserve our attention. Dr. Carson’s heart is in the right place and, as his longtime friend, I feel confident in his ability to be one of the best secretaries HUD has ever seen.

"Vice President Pence refused to answer Wednesday when asked if he believes President Trump's wiretapping claim against former President Obama. Pence was asked during an interview with CNN affiliate WEWS reporter John Kosich about Trump's incendiary claim that Obama tapped Trump Tower during last year's presidential campaign. ""What I can say is that the president and our administration are very confident that the congressional committees in the House and Senate that are examining issues surrounding the last election, the run-up to the last election, will do that in a thorough and equitable way,"" Pence said."
"In the midst of the raging controversies over secret surveillance and new healthcare plans, there were some curious and unsettling sightings in the coverage.  Individuals once thought to have passed from political existence reappeared to hold forth on the very subjects of their demise.   In ancient times such figures were called druagr or, in Old Norse, revenant.  The two most recent revenants were James Clapper and Jonathan Gruber.  They are ample proof that no one really dies in Washington; their scandals just fade away. Clapper on Surveillance Programs James Clapper is being widely quoted as proof that President Donald TrumpDonald TrumpManafort wanted for questioning in Ukraine: report Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' 'Compassionate acts of mercy?': Pelosi slams GOP healthcare plan, Trump budget MORE was lying in saying that there was surveillance of Trump Tower carried out by President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaSpicer slams media for coverage of Russia, wiretapping claims Ex-intelligence official: Napolitano’s British wiretapping claim ‘didn’t get it right’ Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' MORE.  Clapper went public to say categorically that no such surveillance operations occurred. That ended the issue for many in the media.  After all, as the former Director of National Intelligence, Clapper would know right?    When then-National Intelligence Director James Clapper appeared before the Senate, he was asked directly, “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?” Clapper responded, “No, sir. … Not wittingly.” Note this was not a situation like the controversy over Attorney General Jeff SessionsJeff SessionsVan Jones and and Ryan P. Haygood: Trump is wrong on criminal justice THE MEMO: GOP breaks from Trump in 'wiretap' furor Overnight Finance: Inside Trump's first budget | Reaction from Congress | Budget panel advances ObamaCare repeal | Debt ceiling returns MORE who went beyond a question asked him about how he would respond to any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.  Sessions voluntarily stated that he had no interaction with Russians in responding but failed to mention two brief meetings with the Russian ambassador.   Sessions insisted that he was thinking of campaign discussions not any meeting with any Russian at any time.  In comparison, Clapper denied a direct question about the existence of a program that he was fully aware of and the question itself was all too clear. Clapper later admitted that he did not want to answer the question and said that his testimony was “the least untruthful” statement he could make. Yet, of course, that would still make it an untrue statement — which most people call a lie and lawyers call perjury. What was particularly disturbing was the portrayal of Clapper — and the Obama administration generally — as denying that the administration would ever surveil political opponents in such a matter.  This is the same administration that hid the massive secret surveillance program and put journalists under surveillance.  Clapper himself played the most controversial role in misleading Congress on the existence of the program. Unless media is looking for “the least untruthful” answer, Clapper would hardly seem a compelling witness on the existence of surveillance operations.  This is not to say that the media was wrong in asking Clapper about the alleged surveillance given his earlier position. However, he has emerged apparently shed of his highly controversial history. Gruber on Healthcare With the move to repeal and replace ObamaCare, various media outlets turned to MIT professor Jonathan Gruber who is widely referred to as “an architect of Obamacare.”  Gruber promptly denounced the replacement of the law and warned that it could result in 30 million people losing health insurance coverage.  He previously juxtaposed ""a strong and coherent health care agenda"" of President Obama as opposed to Trump's ""garbage salad of right-wing talking points.” Gruber’s resurrection as “an architect” of ObamaCare is impressive even by Washington metrics. It was not long ago that no one in the Obama administration appeared to know Gruber’s name.  While a key person in the drafting of ObamaCare (who received $400,000 to work on Obamacare and made over $2 million from the Department of Health and Human Services), Gruber became persona non grata after he spoke frankly about what was something of a bait-and-switch used to pass Obamacare.    Gruber told an audience at the University of Rhode Island in 2012 that they were able to pass Obamacare because of “the lack of economic understanding of the American voter.” In another view from at an October 2013 event at Washington University in St. Louis, Gruber said “that passed, because the American people are too stupid to understand the difference.”  Likewise, in 2009, Gruber denied that they were really trying to reduce costs as opposed to increase coverage — saying that Obamacare might not produce lower cost health care for many citizens. This statement was made five months before the passage of the Act but not publicly known until long after passage. Following these and other remarks, Democratic leaders suddenly began saying “Gruber who?” Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi expressed a complete lack of knowledge of who Gruber is, was, or will be.  The Obama administration denied that he was really all that important after all. So, with the move to repeal and replace, who surfaces to evaluate the proposals? The man who said that he and others secured passage of ObamaCare in part on the basis of the “stupidity” of the American citizen.  Suddenly he is an architect again and a reliable source. What is fascinating is that there are ample reasons to question both the surveillance allegations and the proposals for a new healthcare system. Yet, there is no interest in the rather checkered history of either of these key players from the prior administration. There are, of course, Republican revenants who seemed to rise Phoenix-like from their political ashes like Gov. Chris Christie or Gov. Rick Perry.   Yet, the use of revenants like Clapper and Gruber reflects the limited attention span of modern media coverage.   It is too much to expect that the credibility of a former official would be relevant for a revenant, particularly when they fit a narrative of a story.  It is Washington’s version of soap opera characters: major figures can suddenly return to life with a simple change in storyline like being found on a desert island or defrosted in some cryogenic lab.   The Obama administration itself had controversies of the veracity of statements on surveillance and health care.  That does not make the statements of Trump or his administration any more true. As the “New York Times’” new ad campaign states, “Truth is hard to find.” But it is all the more difficult when you are looking in all the wrong places.

"The House voted Wednesday to repeal an Obama-era workplace regulation. The Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has long required companies to report workplace injuries and illnesses, but the agency last December extended the time period during which they can be penalized for failing to make these reports to five years.  Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.), who introduced the legislation, called the OSHA rule a “power grab.” Republicans led the charge to repeal the Obama-era rule, which went into effect just days before President Trump’s inauguration. The House voted 231 to 191 to roll back the workplace protections under the Congressional Review Act, which makes it easier for a simple majority of lawmakers to overturn recently published regulations. Six Republicans opposed the measure, while four Democrats supported it. With support from President Trump in the White House, Republican lawmakers have repealed a handful of Obama-era rules without much Democratic support. The Labor Department’s workplace rule could be the latest victim of the Congressional Review Act. The Senate has yet to vote on the bill, but is expected to pass this and a number of similar regulatory repeals after it gets past the confirmation process for Trump’s cabinet nominees.

It's Tuesday evening here in Washington wear women in the House Democratic caucus are dressed in white to honor the women's suffrage ahead of President Trump's address to Congress tonight.    THE BIG STORY  President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday directing the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider the Waters of the U.S. rule.  The rule, which was temporarily blocked by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, gives EPA the authority to regulate the pollution of small waterways like ponds and streams under the Clean Water Act.   As The Hill's Timothy Cama reports, the order is the opening shot by Trump against the EPA, which was a frequent target of criticism from Republicans for alleged overreach under Obama's tenure, and the first step toward repealing the rule. Since the rule is already on hold, Trump's order doesn't change much immediately. It does not repeal the rule, instead directing the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to consider rolling it back, a process likely to take years.

""Now it's time for Congress to step up and do its job by giving EPA direction on what water is jurisdictional under the Clean Water Act--and that's what the bipartisan bill I helped introduce requiring EPA to redo this rule would accomplish.""  In a statement, William Kovacs, senior vice president of environment, technology and regulatory affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, praised Trump for his order Tuesday, calling the rule a federal land grab.  ""The rule would have given the EPA and the Corps unprecedented permitting and enforcement authority over land use decisions that Congress did not authorize,"" he said. ""To add insult to injury, the two agencies refused to properly assess the economic harm the rule would cause, despite the objections of Congress, states, businesses--even other federal agencies.""  Proponents of the rule, meanwhile, slammed Trump, calling his move ""dangerous and illegal.""  ""Water is life, and Trump's dirty water order puts our environment and millions of American lives at risk so that polluters can profit from the destruction of our waterways,"" Friends of the Earth Oceans Campaigner Marissa Knode said in a statement.  ""The Clean Water Rule is grounded in science and the law so that our streams and wetlands can keep us healthy and safe, provide habitat for fish and wildlife, and beautiful places to recreate.""  Read the full story here.    ON TAP FOR WEDNESDAY  The Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing to consider the nomination of Seema Verma to be the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee will hold a hearing on ways to improve access to infrastructure for communities across the country.

"A former policy adviser to President Obama is firing back at President Trump's claim that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, saying it didn't happen — at least not under Obama's orders. ""No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you,"" Ben Rhodes tweeted Saturday morning. He also said ""only a liar"" could make the case, as Trump suggested, that Obama wire tapped Trump Tower ahead of the election. “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” Trump wrote on Twitter early Saturday.  It was not immediately clear whether Trump had any proof or was referencing a report. Breitbart News on Friday reported on conservative radio host Mark Levin’s claim that Obama executed a “silent coup” of Trump via “police state” tactics. White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon was the executive chair of Breitbart before joining Trump’s team.

Former national security advisor Michael Flynn was ousted last month after revelations that he misled top White House officials about the nature of his conversations with Kislyak."
"President Trump on Sunday went after the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and President Obama in a series of early morning tweets. In his first tweet of the day, the president questioned whether the DNC refused to let the FBI have access to its servers after it learned it had been hacked. ""Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked?"" Trump asked. "

Trump accused the Obama administration of wiretapping Trump Tower while he was still a candidate, calling it a ""Nixon/Watergate"" scandal on Twitter.  “We have the tools to keep us safe and it's prudent for those tools to be used lawfully and appropriately,” Gowdy said on Fox. “If they're not used lawfully and appropriately, there's a paper trail and we'll be able to find it out,” he added. Gowdy, a former prosecutor who led the House select committee investigation into the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks, said the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant the Obama administration reportedly used would be available for Trump and his team to review. “The Obama team is no longer in charge, so any information the current Department of Justice has that suggests the previous Department of Justice acted inappropriately, they are welcome to release it,” Gowdy said.  --This report was updated at 3:13 p.m."
"Senate Republicans plan to deliver a final blow Monday to the Labor Department's so-called blacklisting rule.  The Senate will vote on whether to overturn the controversial Obama-era regulation through the Congressional Review Act, which empowers Republicans to roll back recently published rules without Democratic support. The House has already voted to strike down the rule. The blacklisting rule requires federal contractors to disclose labor violations when applying to do business with the government. Proponents say this will help Uncle Sam avoid working with bad actors, but critics say unions could use it as leverage against companies. Republican Sen.

Johnson is pushing the disapproval resolution to overturn the rule.   The Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act is headed to the floor for a vote. The bill requires proof that each proposed member of a class action lawsuit has the same extent of injuries before the lawsuit can be certified by a federal court.  When the bill passed the House in January 2016 in a 211 to 188 vote, it had another piece of legislation attached to it - The Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act. That bill created new requirements for asbestos victims seeking compensation through the court system.  The joint legislation never made it to the Senate.

It also requires that class action lawyers only get paid after the victims and orders any third-party funding agreement to be disclosed to the court. The House is also expected to vote on the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, which has a companion bill in the Senate. It would penalize lawyers who file baseless lawsuits. The House is also working on the Innocent Party Protection Act, which would establish a uniform standard for determining whether a defendant has been wrongly added to a lawsuit.  On Wednesday, a House Science subcommittee will also hold a hearing on regulating outer space. The House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing that same day to examine proposed visa regulations by the Department of Homeland Security.    RECENT STORIES   Meet Trump pick who could lead Russia probe   Senate Republicans eye repeal of Obama-era 'blacklisting rule' EPA pulls back methane request for drillers   Interior secretary repeals ban on lead bullets   House votes to repeal Obama-era workplace protections   House moves forward on commission to repeal rules   More than 200 companies express interest in border wall construction White House: Keystone XL exempt from 'Buy American' push Uber reverses course, will apply for California permit to test self-driving cars FAA chief defends air traffic control after Trump attack FCC votes to block internet privacy rule Robocall crackdown tops agenda for FCC March meeting EPA chief defends grant programs WH is eyeing for cuts Dem senators press companies on Trump nixing overtime rule"
"The Senate on Tuesday voted to end a land management rule finalized in the closing days of the Obama administration. Lawmakers scuttled the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) “Planning 2.0” rule, a measure to modernize federal land management strategies. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution against the rule is the latest measure pushed by Republicans taking aim at Obama-era rules. Once President Trump signs the resolution, it will be the third successful CRA challenge to an environmental measure so far this year. Conservatives have opposed the BLM’s regulation, which they say gives the federal government too much influence over public land decisions and marginalizes state and local input.  “Instead of expanding public participation, Western states are looking at fewer and weaker opportunities to influence the management of local lands. Planning 2.0 also turns the relationship between the federal, the state and the local governments on its head.” Supporters of the rule, though, said it was designed to overhaul the communication process between federal and state officials, something that hasn’t been updated since the early 1980s. “I guarantee you in those 30 years we can come up with a better process for input from our constituents on important land use issues,” Sen. Maria CantwellMaria CantwellSenators want more security funding for Jewish centers Senate passes bill ending Obama-era land rule Senate Dems introduce bill to block Trump's revised travel order MORE (D-Wash.) said. She called the rule “a very important project that has guaranteed public access, transparency and sunshine in planning our public lands.” The Senate repealed the planning rule on a 51-48 vote, making it the fourth CRA resolution Congress has sent to Trump. He has so far signed two resolutions undoing Obama-era environmental issues, including a coal-mining rule and a financial disclosure requirement for drilling and mining firms."
"Former President Obama will return to the national spotlight to accept the John F. Kennedy “Profile in Courage” Award on the 100th anniversary of Kennedy’s birth. Caroline Kennedy, Kennedy’s daughter, and her son, Jack Schlossberg, will present the award to the 44th president this spring. ""President Obama has embodied the definition of courage that my grandfather cites in the opening lines of 'Profiles in Courage': grace under pressure,"" Schlossberg said in a statement. ""Throughout his two terms in office, he represented all Americans with decency, integrity, and an unshakeable commitment to the greater good.”    Obama will join two other past presidents in receiving this award. George H.W. Bush was honored for breaking a campaign promise by raising taxes in order to deal with a deficit crisis, and Gerald R. Ford was recognized for his decision to pardon Richard Nixon. Unlike Ford and Bush, Obama was not chosen to receive the award for a specific decision in office. The committee decided this year they would “do something different this year if we could,” foundation selection committee chairman Al Hunt, a Bloomberg columnist, told BuzzFeed News. The committee was in “total agreement” about the decision to select Obama, he added.  The event will take place on May 7 at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, where Obama will deliver a speech. His speech at the event will be one of the few public appearances Obama has made since leaving office."
"TRUMP KICKS OFF WATER RULE REPEAL: President Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday kicking off the process of repealing former President Obama's Clean Water Rule. The order itself doesn't repeal the regulation, but it instructs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reconsider the rule, also known as Waters of the United States. It's the first action Trump has taken against the EPA, following years of complaints from Republicans and industry about the agency, and multiple campaign promises to rein it in. ""It's a horrible, horrible rule. Has sort of a nice name, but everything else is bad,"" Trump said at a White House signing ceremony, surrounded by Vice President Pence, first lady Melania Trump and top opponents of the regulation, including newly installed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Sen.

But a few years ago, the EPA decided that navigable waters can mean nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmer's land, or any place else that they decide,"" Trump said before signing the order. ""It was a massive power grab. The EPA's regulators are putting people out of jobs by the hundreds of thousands."" The rule is already on hold following a court order, so Trump's move has little immediate effect. Furthermore, it's likely to take years for the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to go through the extensive rulemaking process to repeal and potentially replace the rule. Read more here. EPA head pledges to help farmers: Mere minutes after attending the signing ceremony, Pruitt headed to National Harbor, Md., to assure the agriculture sector that he's got their back. ""If you think about the issues that are particularly important to you, from the Farm Bureau perspective, 'the future ain't what it used to be,'"" Pruitt said at the American Farm Bureau Federation meeting, quoting baseball legend Yogi Berra. Pruitt told attendees that under Obama, federal regulators took a ""we know best"" approach on issues like the environment. Pruitt contrasted that with his own intention to put more regulatory powers under state control. ""That is changing under our leadership at the EPA and President Trump's leadership from the White House,"" Pruitt said to applause. ""Help is on the way."" ""I'm looking forward to the regulatory rollback to provide certainty to you,"" he continued. Read more here. LAWMAKERS TACKLE PROPOSED EPA SPENDING CUT: Lawmakers on Tuesday confronted a potential 24 percent cut to the EPA's budget. Trump is reportedly planning to propose a one-quarter cut to the EPA's $8.1 billion annual budget, a measure that would drive agency spending next year to levels not seen since the George H.W. Bush administration. Key Democrats indicated they will oppose any such spending plan, leaving it to Republicans to muster the votes necessary to advance it. That prospect revealed a GOP divide between members willing to dramatically slash the EPA's budget and those who doubt such a cut can move forward. Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), a former Appropriations Committee chairman and frequent critic of the EPA, said the reported cuts are ""in the neighborhood"" of what he would like to see at the EPA. ""I think they've overreached by a zillion points,"" he said. ""They've overreached their authority, as the courts have held, and the regulations they've imposed on American business have killed thousands of jobs, and they need to be reined back in severely."" Others appropriators, though, were less zealous about taking a hatchet to the agency. ""I'd like to look and seen what actually gets out of committee,"" Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said. ""EPA has been cut by over 20 percent in the last few years. The discretionary budget has been lowered pretty dramatically compared to how it was in 2009, and it's under what Paul RyanPaul  RyanRepublicans pitch healthcare plan ahead of key vote 'Compassionate acts of mercy?': Pelosi slams GOP healthcare plan, Trump budget Ryan on healthcare plan: We believe we should have more assistance for older people MORE thought it would be in his budget.""

KEYSTONE BUILDER PUTS $15B CHALLENGE ON HOLD: TransCanada Corp. is putting on hold its $15 billion claim against the United States government over Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline project. The company made a filing dated Monday at the World Bank, just more than a month after Trump wrote a memo to restart federal consideration of the project, a decision that could make the arbitration moot. TransCanada had argued that Obama's violated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by rejecting the project, in part because a domestic company would have received better treatment. NAFTA allows companies to recover their losses in such cases, through a length arbitration process. Trump asked TransCanada in January to apply again for a presidential permit for the controversial pipeline to cross the Canadian border, and told the State Department to decide within 60 days whether to issue the permit. The pipeline developer sent in its new application days later. Read more here. JUDGE HEARS RELIGIOUS OBJECTION TO DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE: A federal judge says he will rule on a tribe's religious objections to the Dakota Access pipeline within a week. The Cheyenne River Sioux tribe of South Dakota has sued against the embattled project, saying the presence of an oil pipeline under Lake Oahe threatens its religious freedom because the lake's water is used for religious ceremonies. But U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg was skeptical of the claim during oral arguments on Tuesday, E&E News reports, asking the tribe's attorney, ""Where do we draw the line?"" The tribe's attorney said tribal water rights and legal precedent support the claim, but Dakota Access lawyers also cast doubt on the validity of the argument.   Boasberg said he will rule on the dispute by next week.

The Trump administration has said all options are on the table for countering the nuclear threat, according to the report. Trump has previously said North Korea will not obtain nuclear weapons.  The Wall Street Journal in November reported that Obama officials had told members of the Trump transition team that North Korea would be the new administration’s number one national security issue.  North Korea said in September that it had conducted a nuclear test.

According to a survey conducted by the Conference Board, consumer confidence rose to 114.8 in February, the highest level for the index since July 2001, according to an analysis by MarketWatch.    MarketWatch further reported, “A much healthier labor market has lifted the spirits of consumers. The share of those living in the U.S. who said jobs are ‘hard to get,’ for example, fell to an eight-year low of 20.3% in February.” These numbers are bolstered by the tremendous growth in investment that has occurred since Election Day. The mean Down Jones Industrial Average for October 2016 was 18,233. When the markets closed on March 1, 2017, the DJIA closed above 21,000, an all-time high and increase of 15.1 percent compared to October. By comparison, from October 2014 to October 2016, the market only rose by 443 points, an increase of about 2.5 percent. The data is clear: In just a few months, President Trump has done more to improve consumer confidence than President Obama did in his final two years in office. Trump’s generally pro-business approach seems to have already had a positive effect on employment as well. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the three-month period prior to the 2016 election (the end of July through October), total employment rose by 498,000, a 0.41 percent increase. From the end of October through January, employment increased by 580,000, an increase of 0.47 percent. Trump has also succeeded in implementing reforms that will likely have significant economic benefits for years to come. Trump resurrected the Keystone XL Pipeline and granted final approval for the Dakota Access Pipeline, a project that is expected to bring to North Dakota $100 million in additional tax revenues, according to a report by the Associated Press. Trump also implemented a rollback of Obama-era coal-energy regulations and signed an executive order that mandates a review of Dodd-Frank financial regulations, which will eventually help to spur investment and banking. All these early achievements have occurred rapidly and result from policy changes implemented by Trump that radically depart from those that were in place under Obama. It’s not as though Trump and the Republican-led Congress have created results by implementing new and innovative programs, policies, or laws. In fact, very few laws or reforms have been passed by Congress thus far. It seems clear then that the key to Trump’s economic success has simply been to reject Obama’s policies and government-centered ideology. Although Trump and his allies will argue his administration deserves significant praise and recognition for improving the nation’s economic outlook—and he does deserve some credit, clearly—the improved rate of economic growth reveals more about Obama’s disastrous policies than it does Trump’s time in office. Should Trump’s economic gains continue, regardless of whether Trump is able to win the ongoing public-relations war over topics such as immigration and terrorism, it’s hard to imagine him losing against any Democrat, no matter how impressive he or she might be, in 2020. Trump won in 2016 because he was able to capitalize on the growing frustration among historically Democrat-aligned voters in the Upper Midwest, many of whom chose Trump solely for his economic policies. It’s unlikely these voters will reverse course on Trump if he delivers on his promise to improve the economy in the long-forgotten Midwest. This is especially true since it’s likely Trump’s success would bring back to the fold many Republicans who voted for a third-party candidate in 2016.  For instance, in Minnesota, a state that has almost always voted for the Democratic Party candidate for president, Trump lost to Clinton by a mere 44,000 votes. Gary JohnsonGary JohnsonTrump’s early economic success reveals Obama failures, could presage 2020 landslide Trump taps former congresswoman for Air Force secretary Other states should join Jerry Brown's California resistance MORE earned 112,944 votes, and Evan McMullin, a very conservative candidate, earned 53,080 votes. If Trump were to win just 60 percent of these two conservative-leaning voting groups in 2020, he could win Minnesota, making it virtually impossible for a Democrat candidate to win.  Justin Haskins is executive editor of The Heartland Institute and editor-in-chief of the New Revere Daily Press.

"SENATE TARGETS ANOTHER OBAMA RULE: Republicans' deregulatory push resumes this week when the Senate considers another Congressional Review Act (CRA) challenge to an Obama-era rule. The Senate on Monday night will kick off the process for repealing a Bureau of Land Management planning rule, which the Obama administration hoped would reform and update public land strategies. Conservatives, though, say the rule -- called ""Planning 2.0"" -- gives federal regulators too much power over public land and moves state and local input to the backburner. The House in February approved a CRA resolution repealing the rule, and it appears likely to pass in the Senate.  So far, CRA resolutions have scuttled a coal mining pollution rule and a regulation calling for more financial disclosure information from drilling and mining firms. The Planning 2.0 role is next on the chopping block, and members could soon pass a resolution against a methane pollution rule as well.

Exxon said it has kicked off a $20 billion investment in Texas and Louisiana, with its CEO saying the shale oil and gas boom is driving spending in the United States. In a statement, Trump said that is ""is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work. ""Many of the products that will be manufactured here in the United States by American workers will be exported to other countries, improving our balance of trade,"" Trump added of Exxon, which until December was led by now-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. ""This is a true American success story."" Exxon's expansion work -- which began in 2013 and could last through 2022 -- will take place at 11 new or existing chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects in Louisiana and Texas.

Bishop, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, asked the House Budget Committee to put $50 million in the budget to account for costs associated with land transfers. In his request, Bishop argued that ""poorly managed federal lands create a burden for surrounding states and communities."" He reasoned that divesting the federal government of its land would be good for the federal budget. It would reduce the costs of maintaining that land, he said, as well as the payments the federal government makes to local and state governments for tax dollars they can't collect. ""To allow for these conveyances to start immediately, we ask that you build in $50 million into the budget to cover possible impacts on offsetting receipts,"" Bishop wrote. ""The vitality of these lands, after being conveyed from the federal government, will reduce the need for other taxpayer-funded federal support, either through Payments in Lieu of Taxes or other programs such as Secure Rural Schools.""

HOUSE GOP TARGETS EPA 'SECRET SCIENCE': House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) is once again going after what he see as the use of ""secret science"" in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rulemaking. Smith introduced the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act (HONEST Act) Monday, the latest iteration of his proposal to reform how the EPA uses science. ""The HONEST Act of 2017 is about ensuring public access to the very science that underpins rules and regulations by EPA,"" he said in a statement. ""This bill would prohibit any future regulations from taking effect unless the underlying scientific data is public."" Democrats, environmentalists and others have fought the GOP's ""secret science"" legislation in the past, arguing that the agency is already transparent with its research and the proposals would put up significant new regulatory barriers.

"Former President Obama was reportedly furious after President Trump fired off tweets accusing him of wiretapping Trump Tower before the presidential election, according to a new report. An aide to Obama told The Wall Street Journal the former president had decided he would not respond to every one of the his successor's tweets. But people familiar with Obama's thinking told the Journal he was livid after Trump posted several tweets early Saturday morning making serious accusations. “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” Trump first tweeted on Saturday, without evidence. An Obama spokesman later responded: “A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,” said Kevin Lewis. “As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.”  Trump also reportedly believes that officials loyal to Obama have been behind the leaks coming out of the administration. Christopher Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax Media and a friend of the president, told the Journal that “Trump’s people think Obama is at war with them.” He reiterated the idea that allies of president Obama were behind “a lot of the problems.” “This president has been under siege since Day One from both the press and Obama loyalists and he’s reacting to it,” Ruddy said. “I don’t think there’s any doubt that Obama loyalists inside the administration and outside are giving Donald TrumpDonald TrumpManafort wanted for questioning in Ukraine: report Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' 'Compassionate acts of mercy?': Pelosi slams GOP healthcare plan, Trump budget MORE a lot of grief and a lot of problems.”"

"Obama administration officials worked to diffuse information throughout the government about Russia’s meddling in the U.S. presidential election and alleged contacts between associates of President Trump and Russian officials as Obama's term ended, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The officials’ goals, they said, were to leave a trail of intelligence for future investigators and to prevent another meddling attempt in a U.S. or European election. The situation was described by more than six current and former officials to the Times.  Officials sought to disseminate the information through the government by asking certain questions during intelligence briefings that would be put on the record, maintaining as low of a classification level as possible on reports, and providing lawmakers, like Sen. Ben CardinBen CardinTrump's budget revealed his priorities. Now the fun begins. As US healthcare changes, preventative screenings can't stop Trump, Tillerson must keep US on the human rights high ground MORE (D-Md.), with documents, apparently to make any future investigations easier.  On the other hand, officials worked to further protect particularly sensitive information, the report said, such as the identities of sources and foreign individuals who were under surveillance.  President Obama did not direct the effort, officials said. Obama did call for a full report on Russian efforts, a declassified version of which was released near the end of his presidency.  The intelligence community report released concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin called for an influence campaign aimed at helping Trump win the White House. “This situation was serious, as is evident by President Obama's call for a review — and as is evident by the United States response,” Eric Schultz, Obama’s spokesman, told the newspaper. “When the intelligence community does that type of comprehensive review, it is standard practice that a significant amount of information would be compiled and documented.” The New York Times reported last month that a number of Trump campaign aides and associates were in contact with Russian officials through the campaign. The White House and Russia have strongly denied the allegations. "

"President Donald TrumpDonald TrumpManafort wanted for questioning in Ukraine: report Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' 'Compassionate acts of mercy?': Pelosi slams GOP healthcare plan, Trump budget MORE’s speech at last week’s CPAC meeting was a stirring reiteration of themes deployed throughout his campaign and in his inaugural address. Like a rock star packaging a series of concerts, the President has undertaken an “American carnage” tour. Everywhere he goes, he takes pains to remind his listeners that the country he now leads is “a mess. At home and abroad, a mess.” At the center of the mess that Trump conjures is the problem of violent crime. At CPAC, he again highlighted it and promised to work with the “Department of Justice to being (sic) reducing violent crime.”    Trump’s Chicago would seem to be worse off today than it was during the notorious crime era of the Roaring Twenties. And, listening to the President you would think that Chicago is America’s most dangerous city. That “honor” actually goes to Detroit, and a recent study based on crime rates and economic data did not even find Chicago to be one of the ""25 Most Dangerous Cities in America.”  It turns out that 7 of the 10 America’s most dangerous cities are found in states that Trump won.  These are cities like Memphis, Tennessee; St. Louis, Missouri; Birmingham, Alabama; Cleveland, Ohio; and Indianapolis, Indiana. The last should especially draw a wince from Trump’s Vice President, Mike PenceMike (Michael) Richard PenceRepublicans pitch healthcare plan ahead of key vote Pence ally part owner of conservative news outlet: report Merkel's visit could salvage some sort of US-EU trade deal MORE, who was Indiana’s governor from 2013 to 2017. These are, of course, the kind of inconvenient facts that Donald Trump likes to avoid. If we think about crime in the country as a whole, there are more inconvenient facts. FBI crime statistics estimated that 1,197,704 violent crimes were committed around the nation in 2015. While that was an increase from 2014 figures, the 2015 violent crime total was 0.7 percent lower than the 2011 level and 16.5 percent below the 2006 level. The murder rate shows a more dramatic decline: in 2014 there were 4.5 murders for every 100,000 people in the US. That figure has fallen consistently since its high point of 10.2 in 1980. Today’s murder rate is lower than it has been since 1950 when it was 4.6 per 100,000 people But these inconvenient facts make no dent on Trump’s current law and order rhetoric which he began ratcheting last July, after the tragic mass shooting of police officers in Dallas, Texas. Accepting the Republican nomination, he pointed out that “America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed…. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message,” he said, “to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country…In this race for the White House, I am the Law and Order candidate.” Others have noted how this turn echoes the law and order campaigns of President Richard Nixon. True, but I think Trump also learned an important political lesson from an insight Barack ObamaBarack ObamaSpicer slams media for coverage of Russia, wiretapping claims Ex-intelligence official: Napolitano’s British wiretapping claim ‘didn’t get it right’ Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' MORE offered during the 2008 Presidential campaign, when he imprudently noted that older, white men in the United States seemed angry and politically confused, such that they would vote against their own economic best interest. As Obama put it, “You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and, like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them… And it's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.” Sarah Palin made fun of Obama’s wording in the 2008 campaign, but it expressed a sentiment that was all too well understood by the Republican candidate in 2016. Donald Trump saw an enormous opportunity to capitalize on those frustrations if he could wrap himself in the flag, patriotism, the Second Amendment, and the rhetoric of law and order. He has relied on this rhetoric to deliver a coded message about race and to stoke racial fear, while allowing him to deny allegations of racism or that he is responsible for escalating racial and ethnic tensions in the US. Lest there be any doubt about Trump’s intentions, his current message echoes views vividly expressed in an ad he ran in New York newspapers after the arrests of one Latino and four black men (known as the Central Park Five) in the rape and beating of a white jogger in 1989. The ad was titled “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY, BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” It read: “Let our politicians give back our police department’s power to keep us safe. Unshackle them from the constant chant of ‘police brutality’ which every petty criminal hurls immediately at an officer who has just risked his or her life to save another’s. We must cease our continuous pandering to the criminal population of this City. Give New York back to the citizens who have earned the right to be New Yorkers.” How little things have changed for Donald Trump since the 1980s. Once again, it is far easier for the President to praise American law enforcement and to rail against “bad dudes” and “bad hombres” than it is to address the real causes of crime and violence in American cities or to restore America’s manufacturing base and improve the economic lives of our workers. Americans need to come to terms with this shrewd but cynical move. We need to understand the political work that Trump’s law and order rhetoric does for him, but also the damage it does to the social fabric of the nation he leads. We must resist its divisive allure and recognize that the most significant threat to law and order in the United States is found not on the streets of Chicago, but in the Oval Office.

"President Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Saturday night added to President Trump's allegations earlier in the day of wiretapping on the part of the Obama administration.

""What we've seen from the previous administration was that they did spend time listening to conversations between then-Sen. Jeff Sessions [R-Ala.] and the ambassador to Russia while he was in his U.S. senate office,"" Lewandowski claimed. ""What other conversations did they listen in on from the American public?""  ""Woah, woah, woah,"" she interjected. ""You're saying that they were listening to conversations between then-Sen. Sessions and the Russian ambassador Kislyak? Or are you talking about Mike Flynn and Kislyak?"" she asked, referring to Trump's first national security adviser Michael Flynn. ""I'm talking about Jeff Sessions,"" Lewandowski responded. ""Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions met with the ambassador one time during the Republican National Convention, but more importantly, the second time that he met with him was in the United States Senate office,"" he continued. ""They were monitoring when a United States senator was having a private conversation, is what I understand. And if that is the case that's very concerning. And so is it possible that the previous administration was listening to the conversations that took place in Trump Tower?"" Lewandowski did not cite specific evidence or reports to back up the claim. ""I am unaware of any claim of them listening to a conversation as opposed to them being aware of a meeting between then-Sen. Sessions and Ambassador Kislyak,"" Pirro said. The accusations stem from a Wednesday report by The Washington Post that revealed Sessions had two undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador in July and September, meetings confirmed by Justice Department officials. Past reports from The New York Times and CNN have referenced U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials examining intercepted communications involving Russian officials and other Trump associates. Lewandowki's comments on the program Saturday came as he weighed in on Trump's claim that Obama had his ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower before the election. Trump also tweeted the accusation without offering evidence. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway had been scheduled for Saturday's show, but Pirro said she had been rescheduled for Sunday's show, noting other guests such as Lewandowski would appear Saturday instead. The White House has yet to provide information to back up Trump's tweets. “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” Trump wrote early Saturday. “Is it legal for a sitting President to be ""wire tapping"" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!” he added. “I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!” A spokesman for Obama rejected the accusation, saying that ""neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false."" Sessions recused himself on Thursday from any federal investigation into Russia's intervention in the election amid pressure from lawmakers following the disclosure of his talks with Kislyak. Sessions denied that he intentionally misled lawmakers during his confirmation hearing when he did not mention his conversations with the Russian official. He argued he carried out the talks in his role as an Alabama senator and not in his capacity as a Trump adviser."
"President Trump on Tuesday morning accused former President Obama of being too weak on Russia, saying Moscow “got stronger and stronger” during his predecessor’s tenure. “For eight years Russia 'ran over' President Obama, got stronger and stronger, picked-off Crimea and added missiles.

"Senate Democrats are pushing the Trump administration to preserve the strict car emissions standards set under former President Obama. The 12 Democrats, led by Sen. Ed MarkeyEd MarkeySenate Dems introduce bill to rescind Trump border wall, immigration order  Dem lawmakers propose bill to regulate drone data collection Senate advances Coats as national intel chief MORE (Mass.), sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) head Scott Pruitt on Tuesday, days after the New York Times and other outlets reported that Pruitt will act as soon as this week to start weakening the greenhouse gas emissions standards. “These automobile emissions standards are economically feasible and technologically achievable for the auto industry,” the senators wrote, citing the EPA’s decision at the end of the Obama administration to maintain the rules for the 2022 to 2025 model years, despite auto industry pleas.  Markey, who helped write the 2007 law the led to the standards, said that the rules helped the domestic auto industry recover from the recession, while reducing dependence on foreign oil. A rollback “would undoubtedly lead to costly litigation and create needless uncertainty for the auto industry, and threaten the economic and employment gains automakers have made in recent years,” he told reporters Tuesday. “Strong fuel efficiency standards have put American consumers in the driver’s seat, and that’s where they should stay.” The EPA’s standards set greenhouse gas limits for vehicles, limits that strengthen throughout the time period ending in 2025. They were set jointly with the Department of Transportation’s fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, and the two agencies work together to administer a single program. Automakers agreed to the standards in 2012, but only under the condition that each agency evaluate by 2018 whether the standards are still feasible. The EPA concluded in January that its part of the standards were feasible. That conclusion angered the industry, which said that the rules are unnecessarily expensive, and has asked Trump to formally reconsider them. Both the EPA and DOT are reportedly planning to do that, launching the process as early as this week. “Rolling back these commonsense, highly successful and overwhelmingly popular clean car standards are beyond disgraceful,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president for legislative affairs at the League of Conservation Voters. “They’re doing exactly what they were designed to do: protect our health and climate, reduce our oil consumption, save consumers money and create jobs.”"
"White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday said that President Trump won’t withdraw his claim that former President Obama wiretapped him during the 2016 election. “Why would he withdraw it until it’s adjudicated?” Spicer asked. Spicer wouldn’t comment further during Tuesday's briefing about whether there is evidence to support Trump’s accusation and said that the House and Senate intelligence committees should look into the president’s claim.  “And I think that what he wants them to do is look into wiretapping, other surveillance, and again, as I mentioned before, the other leaks that are threatening our national security,” Spicer continued. Spicer reiterated that the intelligence committees in both chambers need to investigate both Trump’s wiretapping allegation and the leaks coming out of the White House. “I think the appropriate thing to do is ask the House and Senate to look into it,” Spicer said. Over the weekend, Trump tweeted a claim — without any evidence — that the former president wiretapped Trump Tower to monitor him ahead of the November election. "

Press reports suggest that the administration is looking at an early return to the moon, using commercial partnerships. To understand the task that the president and whomever he chooses as NASA administrator have before them, it is useful to look back on how profoundly and adroitly President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaSpicer slams media for coverage of Russia, wiretapping claims Ex-intelligence official: Napolitano’s British wiretapping claim ‘didn’t get it right’ Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' MORE crippled the space agency’s efforts to send astronauts beyond low Earth orbit. When Obama came into office, he did what a number of other presidents have done to determine their goals for NASA: he formed a presidential commission to study the space agency and come up with some recommendations. The Augustine Commission, so named after its chairman former Lockheed Martin CEO Norm Augustine, returned with a set of recommendations some months later. The commission found that the program then in existence, Project Constellation, was not executable under any reasonable budget. The program, started by President George W. Bush, had been underfunded and had faced technical challenges for years. The commissions offered two alternatives. The first was Moon First, which would have focused America’s efforts on a return to the moon. The second was Flexible Path, which would have sent American astronauts to every destination besides the moon—the asteroids, the moons of Mars, and so on. Both options would lead to the holy grail of space exploration enthusiasts, a mission to Mars. The kicker was that both options would cost an extra $3 billion a year for NASA to execute. For the Obama administration, which was not shy about spending money in areas that it cared about, this price tag was too dear to bear.  The government’s response was formulated in secret. The results of these private deliberations were rolled out in the 2011 budget request that was released in February 2010. Project Constellation would be canceled, root and branch. Instead, NASA would conduct studies of heavy-lift rockets, deep-space propulsion, and other technologies that it was said, in the fullness of time, would make exploring space cheaper and easier. Congress, which had not been consulted, reacted with bipartisan fury. The Obama administration made two critical errors. It had not consulted with Congress or anyone else when it developed its plans to kill Constellation. The White House also blatantly pulled a bureaucratic dodge that was apparent even to a first-term member of the House from the sticks. To kill a popular program, one studies it to death. Nowhere in the Obama plan was there a commitment to send astronauts anywhere. Clearly, the White House had no intention of doing space exploration. President Obama had expressed an antipathy to American exceptionalism, and nothing speaks to that quality than American astronauts exploring other worlds. When Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, Gene Cernan, the last man on the Moon, and Jim Lovell, the hero of Apollo 13, sent an open letter condemning the cancellation of Constellation, President Obama knew he had a problem on his hands. So, with Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin in tow as a political prop, Obama went down to the Kennedy Space Center to make his big space announcement. We would go to Mars, sometime in the next 30 years and visit an Earth-approaching asteroid before that. We would not go back to the moon because we had already been there.  Of course, Obama was no more interested in exploring space than he was before. The Journey to Mars, as NASA eventually called it, was set so far into the future, the mid-2030s, as to be meaningless. Mars was the bright, shiny object to distract people from the vacuous nature of Obama’s space policy.  Congress mandated the development of the Orion spacecraft and the heavy-lift Space Launch System, with designs meticulously spelled out to deny NASA any wiggle room to play slow walk games. These bits of hardware will be available around the end of the decade along with commercial vehicles. Obama wasted eight years that might have been spent getting Americans beyond low Earth orbit. The Journey to Mars has been the ObamaCare of space exploration--expensive, unsustainable, and not designed to do what it is alleged to do. Part of the mandate of the current president to make America great again will be to turn that situation around and America back toward the stars.

"The Senate is moving forward with a plan to strike down a controversial Obama-era labor regulation. The GOP-controlled Senate will vote Monday on whether to repeal the Labor Department’s so-called blacklisting rule through the Congressional Review Act, which gives Republicans the power to overturn certain Obama-era regulations without any Democratic support. The blacklisting rule requires federal contractors to disclose labor violations committed or alleged in the last three years for bidding on contracts over $500,000.  Proponents say it will help the federal government avoid doing business with companies that treat their employees poorly. But critics argue it could subject these companies to unfair pressure from unions.  Johnson is one of the top senators on regulatory issues. The chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee introduced a disapproval resolution against the blacklisting rule under the Congressional Review Act. “This regulation would be used as a form of federally sanctioned blackmail,” Johnson said. It has “the very real potential of subjecting perfectly innocent contractors to blackmail and extortion tactics during union contract negotiations,” he added. But then-Labor Secretary Tom Perez defended the blacklisting rule when his agency issued it last August. “Contractors that illegally cut corners at the expense of their workers should not benefit from taxpayer-funded federal contracts,” said Perez, who recently became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The House already voted to eliminate the blacklisting rule. If the Senate follows suit Monday, it would go to President Trump’s desk for final approval. This could put Trump between a rock and a hard place: The president has called for regulatory reform in Washington, but the working-class voters who helped elect Trump could see this as a betrayal if he sides with federal contractors over their employees."

Senators on Monday will begin the process of repealing a Bureau of Land Management rule to reorganize the government’s land planning and management guidelines.  The House passed a Congressional Review Act resolution against the rule on a 234-186 vote in early February. Under the CRA, resolutions undoing regulations require only a majority vote in the Senate, meaning Republicans are likely to have enough votes to pass the measure.   “This rule takes authority away from those who know best what we need to do to manage and sustain our resources, and it puts it in the hands of the federal government and bureaucrats here in Washington, D.C.,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the resolution’s sponsor in the House, said during floor debate.  Conservation groups support the rule, which they say updates outdated federal strategies and preserves public land holdings. If approved by the Senate this week and signed by the president, it will be the third energy- or environment-related CRA resolution the GOP has used to undo Obama administration rules. Republicans have so far used the CRA to scrap a water quality regulation on the coal industry and another designed to force mining and drilling firms to disclose more financial information.  Members are also lining up a resolution blocking a rule cracking down on methane leaks from natural gas drilling sites. The House approved that resolution last month, but the Senate has yet to move on it."
"Former National Security Agency and CIA Director Michael Hayden dismissed President Trump’s claim that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. Appearing on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” Tuesday night, Hayden responded “no” when asked by the host if it's possible that Obama ordered surveillance on Trump Tower.  “So the only part of the U.S. government, which has the authority, the only part of the U.S. government that can grant the authority to do that, is a federal judge.” Obama, through a spokesman, denied Trump’s allegations that he ordered any surveillance. ""A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,"" said Kevin Lewis in a statement. ""As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen,"" Lewis added. ""Any suggestion otherwise is simply false."" Hayden also responded to a report from WikiLeaks that said the CIA is hacking smartphone and television devices to spy on their owners.  “I can tell you that these tools would not be used against an American,” he said."
"Some House Democrats have repeatedly voted to overturn regulations that were issued under President Obama, breaking with their party. At least one Democrat has voted for 13 of the last 14 resolutions passed by the House under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a tool that gives Republicans the power to cancel regulations issued in the final months of the Obama administration.  Six Democrats backed that measure, which canceled a requirement that the Social Security Administration report people who receive disability benefits and have a mental health condition to the FBI’s background check system. A few Democrats also broke ranks on votes to eliminate the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council’s so-called blacklisting rule, end the Interior Department’s stream protection rule and cancel a Health and Human Services regulation that prevented states from withholding funds for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood. Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.), a longtime opponent of abortion rights, voted against Obama’s Planned Parenthood rule, saying he wanted to return funding decisions to the states. “It’s certainly not something that I support,” Lipinski told The Hill. “The states should have the ability to decide if they’re going to not direct funding to organizations that provide abortions.” Lipinski also joined the Republicans in voting to overturn a rule limiting the power of states to require drug tests for receiving federal unemployment benefits. Encouraging drug tests, Lipinski said, would both help government officials identify addicts and incentivize users to “get cleaned up.” “I know there’s a lot of disagreement over this on my side,” Lipinski said. “[But] we have a big drug-addiction problem right now, and maybe this is the way to help people get the help that they need.” For the lawmakers who bucked their party on the votes, the political fallout will almost certainly be negligible. That’s because almost all of those rogue lawmakers are either Capitol Hill veterans, safely seated in districts where serious challenges are rare and reelection is all but assured, or they represent regions where defying their party on regulatory issues will play well with voters. Lipinski, now in his seventh term, said he’s heard no criticism from constituents over the votes but did get “the usual” grief from Democrats defending Obama’s legacy. “Obviously, out here [in Washington], both sides stick with the party,” he said. Lipinski won reelection overwhelmingly in 2014, with 65 percent of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2016, though he could be a GOP target in 2018. Rep. Henry Cuellar (Texas) voted affirmatively on 10 of the 14 resolutions, more than any other Democrat. “Anybody that gets up here to vote with the party is doing a disservice to the public. I come up here to do what I think is right,” he said. “If I agree with the Democrats as a Democrat, I’ll do it, but if I disagree, I will disagree.” Cuellar said he’s been voting this way for the last 12 years and doesn’t fear any political fallout. Like Lipinski, he won reelection with a comfortable margin — 66 percent to 31 percent — in a district where Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonHalperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' Republicans take heat on Trump's tax returns Trump: Elizabeth Warren running against me would be 'a dream'  MORE  prevailed in the presidential election in November. “Are all the protections gone? Of course not,” he said. “The ones I feel are unnecessary, of course, I’m going to vote against. It doesn’t mean that if you vote against that rule every protection for water or every protection for workers is gone.” Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) was next in line, voting for seven of the 14 resolutions. He supported overturning the rule prohibiting the coal industry from polluting streams near mines, the rule requiring energy companies to disclose the payments they make to foreign governments and the rule creating protections for Alaskan bears and other predators. He also voted to remove restrictions on state drug testing for unemployment benefits and the rule barring states from withholding money for abortion providers. “I’m 100 percent pro-life. Why wouldn’t I vote that way?” he asked. Peterson noted that he was behind efforts in the mid-1990s to pass the CRA. “We were trying to rein in regulations back then,” he said. “We have given these agencies way more power than they should have. They have more power to legislate than we do.” Peterson hails from a rural Minnesota district that favored President Trump by a whopping 62 percent to 31 percent — Trump’s largest margin in a district where the Democrat won the House race. Given the region’s conservative tilt, Peterson’s votes to gut Obama-era regulations will likely prove a credit, not a liability, in the eyes of voters, who handed Peterson his 14th term by a slim margin of 53 percent to 47 percent. Though a GOP target in 2018, Peterson said he’s not at all concerned about his voting record hurting his chances for reelection. “I’ve been doing this for 27 years,” he said. “It’s not any surprise to my constituents.” California Rep. Jim Costa  (D) voted to repeal the stream protection rule, the rule requiring federal contractors to report past labor law violations when procuring government contracts and a pollution rule for oil and natural gas drillers. “My view is, not withstanding good intentions, the unintended consequences of the regulations that are often promulgated have very devastating results in terms of people who have to comply with them,” he said. “I look at this regulatory re-evaluation as an opportunity to pick and choose, from my own perspective, which make sense and which I think are an overreach.” Like the others, Costa, who won in November with 58 percent of the vote, said he’s simply doing what’s best for his district. “When you have this kind of [state-federal] overlap, I think it’s incumbent upon me, as the federal representative, to take that into account,” he said. Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who is a GOP target in 2018, voted with five other Democrats to repeal the Obama gun rule. She also joined four other Democrats in voting to repeal both the Education Department’s rule limiting federal grants for teacher preparation programs and the Labor Department rule requiring employers to keep records on workplace injuries and illnesses for five years. Sinema is a relative newcomer in a red-leaning district near Phoenix that favored Trump. But while the third-term Arizonian has been a past target of the Republicans, her margin of victory has grown with her incumbency, and she won in November easily, 61 percent to 39 percent. When asked about her support for the resolutions on her way out of the Capitol Thursday, Sinema said she votes for bills she agrees with and hopped in her car. Conversely, a handful of Republicans voted against the resolutions, including Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.), who voted no on eight of the 14 resolutions. As a mirror reflection of Peterson’s race, Ros-Lehtinen found victory in a blue-leaning district that favored Clinton by 20 points — the Democratic nominee’s best showing in a region where the GOP won the House. With that in mind, Ros-Lehtinen’s defense of Obama’s regulations will preclude potential attacks from future Democratic challengers. Ros-Lehtinen fared better than Peterson in 2016, winning a 15th term with 55 percent of the vote, but both lawmakers will likely be high on the opposing party’s target list in 2018. “I look at the them individually and how they might impact the environment, which is something my constituents and I care deeply about,” Ros-Lehtinen said. “It’s not a cookie-cutter yes or a cookie-cutter no. I look at them individually.” The only resolution that passed without a single Democratic vote was to overturn rules that require states to develop a system to hold schools accountable under the Every Student Succeeds Act. Many of the CRA resolutions have yet to pass the Senate. Trump has signed three of them so far."
"Former White House press secretary Jay Carney fired back at Sean Spicer after the current press secretary said providing evidence to back up President Trump's accusations of wiretapping was ""above my pay grade."" Spicer on Tuesday held his first press conference since February, during which he took a handful of questions on Trump's accusation Saturday that former President Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. Trump's accusation did not include any evidence to back it up. When asked during Tuesday's press briefing whether he could now offer any evidence, Spicer responded, ""No, that's above my pay grade."" Carney immediately hit Spicer's statement on Twitter.    “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” Trump first tweeted on Saturday. An Obama spokesman, Kevin Lewis, later responded: “A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.”  Trump's allegation has widened a rift between Trump and his predecessor, according to reports, who made an effort to be cordial during the transition. "

Haygood: Trump is wrong on criminal justice THE MEMO: GOP breaks from Trump in 'wiretap' furor Overnight Finance: Inside Trump's first budget | Reaction from Congress | Budget panel advances ObamaCare repeal | Debt ceiling returns MORE has asked dozens of U.S. attorneys appointed by former President Obama to submit their resignations, the Department of Justice announced Friday. U.S. attorneys are normally replaced at the beginning of new administrations. Of the 93 U.S. attorneys, 46 remain from the past administration, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Sessions asked for the federal prosecutors to resign ""in order to ensure a uniform transition,"" DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. “As was the case in prior transitions, many of the United States Attorneys nominated by the previous administration already have left the Department of Justice,"" the spokeswoman said. The DOJ said career prosecutors in Sessions' office would continue investigations and prosecutions until the new U.S. attorneys are confirmed. The call for resignations applies to all Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorneys, including Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. That comes as a surprise, as Bharara reportedly met with Trump after the election and agreed to remain in his position during the Trump administration. Sessions also asked him to stay, the prosecutor told The New York Times. Once the resignations are submitted, it would be Trump's decision on whether to accept all of them. Sen.

"Norm Eisen, former White House ethics lawyer to President Obama, knocked President Trump on Wednesday for his reaction to a federal judge's ruling immediately halting his second travel ban, saying that Trump's remarks could hurt him if he challenges the ruling. ""Legal disaster--he is digging grave for the second [executive order] and maybe the 3rd one,"" Eisen said in a tweet. The tweet appeared to be referring to Trump's statements during a rally in Nashville, Tenn., that his new travel ban was ""a watered-down version of the first one."" U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson, a President Obama appointee, ruled after a hearing on Wednesday that the state of Hawaii and a Muslim leader showed a ""strong"" likelihood of success in their lawsuit against the ban and put a nationwide restraining order in place. The plaintiffs argued that the policy violates the Establishment Clause and proved that ""irreparable harm"" is likely if temporary relief is not granted.  ""I think we ought to go back to the first [ban], and go all the way,"" he added. ""That’s what I wanted to do in the first place.” Some political observers responded that the statements during the rally could be used against Trump in court, citing Watson's Wednesday ruling, which used the words of multiple Trump allies as a justification for blocking the ban. Watson noted that senior adviser Stephen Miller said in a Fox News interview that the revised order was fundamentally the same as the first despite a few key changes intended to bolster the administration's case in court. There’s nothing “secret about the motive of Trump’s executive order"" Watson added before quoting top Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, who said Trump originally called it a ""Muslim ban."""
"President Donald TrumpDonald TrumpManafort wanted for questioning in Ukraine: report Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' 'Compassionate acts of mercy?': Pelosi slams GOP healthcare plan, Trump budget MORE is scheduled to visit Detroit on Wednesday and, once there, will meet with the auto industry's top brass at the American Center for Mobility — the future site of a massive testing facility for self-driving cars. Once complete, the 335-acre Willow Run site, west of Detroit and home to a B-24 bomber assembly plant during World War II, will be one of the most-advanced automotive testing facilities in world.    On Wednesday, the administration is widely expected to take the first steps to reopen the debate on long-term greenhouse gas and light-vehicle emission standards locked into place by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the final days of the Obama administration — an 11th-hour move that rankled many in the industry. Last month, when speaking of healthcare reform, Trump famously opined, “Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.”  Well, in resurrecting the debate on vehicle emissions standards, the president will likely find out the auto business can be hugely complicated as well.   Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is the gatekeeper of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and the EPA controls fuel efficiency by limiting vehicle emissions. While the two terms are often used interchangeably, it’s not entirely accurate to do so. CAFE standards, first enacted in 1975, grew out of a need to conserve gasoline in light of the 1973 oil embargo. The emphasis was not on reducing pollution, but, rather, reducing gasoline use. Hence, fuel economy, which measures how many miles a vehicle travels on a gallon of gas, was born. Carmakers are required by the NHTSA to meet CAFE standards. If they miss, fines are levied.  Fuel consumption can be lowered by a variety of methods, including making a vehicle smaller and lighter, which could arguably make it less safe. That is why the NHTSA governs CAFE to ensure safety is not compromised by a push to lower consumption. Fuel efficiency, on the other hand, is regulated by the EPA and measures how well your vehicle uses fuel. By advocating improved fuel efficiency, the EPA is protecting the environment by forcing automakers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). To meet tougher standards, light vehicles must become more efficient, i.e., burn less fuel, or pay a Gas Guzzler tax.  But the NHSTA and the EPA are not the only players in the internal-combustion game. California’s Air Resources Board (CARB), established in 1967, has repeatedly petitioned and won a waiver from the EPA for the right to enforce its own air pollution regulations, becoming the only state permitted to issue emissions standards under the federal Clean Air Act.    Under Section 177 of the Clean Air Act, other states are allowed to adopt California’s motor vehicle emissions standards; currently 13 states (representing roughly one-third of all vehicle sales in the U.S.) are following California’s lead. Known as ""Section 177 states"", they are primarily in the Northeast and Northwest — Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The District of Columbia also follows CARB’s standards.  Yes, it’s complicated: Three powerful entities all regulating essentially the same thing — how much fuel your vehicle burns — as you run your daily commute. The last time fuel economy and emission standards were in the spotlight was 2011. Then, automakers and regulators agreed to a highly-ambitious goal of 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by model year 2025. As part of the agreement, a mid-term review of the progress being made by the industry was commissioned, and, on July 18, 2016, the EPA, NHTSA, and CARB jointly released a Draft Technical Assessment Report (TAR), the first step in the mid-term review process scheduled to wrap up in April 2018 with agreement on long-term, 2025 goals. However, when the EPA locked in greenhouse gas and light-vehicle emission standards for the years 2022-2025 at the end of the Obama administration's second term, it effectively shut down the review process that was created to bring all the relevant parties together.    When speaking with automakers, it’s clear that a single, national standard vetted and agreed by all parties — the NHTSA, the EPA, CARB — is the desired result. In such a scenario, the “California Waiver” would not be necessary. By resurrecting the debate and formally finishing the mid-term review already begun with the TAR, the administration could open the door to that possibility.  President Donald Trump has boldly stated his desire to reduce regulations. Finally establishing a single, federal standard would go a long way toward fulfilling that campaign pledge. Can we get there?  Well, it’s complicated. But a formal review of the long-term goals, with all parties at the table, would certainly help.   Rebecca Lindland is executive analyst for Kelley Blue Book (KBB.com), a Cox Automotive™ brand.

"The Obama administration spent $36.2 million defending itself in Freedom of Information Act lawsuits in its final year, The Associated Press reported Tuesday. According to the AP's analysis, some of the biggest targets for record requests were the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department. The Justice Department spent $12 million, Homeland Security spent $6.3 million and legal costs totaled $4.8 million for the Defense Department. The administration also set records for its denial of access to requested documents and information, the news service reported, as well as the number of times federal workers claimed that could not find information that was requested by members of the public.  During Obama's final term in office, the number of FOIA lawsuits filed by news organizations increased drastically.

Justice Department lawyers revealed the decision late Wednesday in a filing with the Denver-based Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, where the federal government under had been fighting against the oil and natural gas industry and conservative states to get the rule reinstated. It is the latest in a series of high-profile Obama environmental rules the Trump administration is repealing or working to change.  Earlier Wednesday, President Trump asked the Environmental Protection Agency to consider weakening greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars. Trump has ordered the EPA to consider repealing Obama’s Clean Water Rule, and will soon seek to undo the Clean Power Plan, the coal leasing moratorium for federal land and other climate and environmental regulations. Attorneys said the Interior Department and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have been reviewing rules as part of a White House directive on reducing unnecessary and burdensome regulations. “As part of this process, the department has begun reviewing the 2015 final rule … for consistency with the policies and priorities of the new administration,” lawyers wrote. “This initial review has revealed that the 2015 final rule does not reflect those policies and priorities.” Attorneys said that Interior would formally propose to repeal the rule within 90 days. That will start a process, likely to take a year or more, of undoing a rule that was a high priority for Obama and took many years to write. Greens slammed the Trump administration’s decision Wednesday. “This disturbing decision highlights Trump’s desire to leave our beautiful public lands utterly unprotected from oil industry exploitation,” Michael Saul, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “Backing away from these modest rules is doubly dangerous given the administration’s reckless plans to ramp up fracking and drilling on public lands across America.” The move comes as little surprise. The rule was a top target of the oil and natural gas industry as well as Republicans – all key allies to Trump. The rule set standards in three areas for federal-land fracking: integrity of well casing, storage of waste fluids and public disclosure of the chemicals used. It was written in part to respond to suspicion and anger from the public regarding the controversial oil and gas extraction technique, which has grown exponentially and been behind the boom in domestic energy production and resulting low prices. Wyoming federal Judge Scott Skavdahl, an Obama nominee, blocked the rule last year. He accepted arguments from industry and a handful of states that the BLM is prohibited by federal law from regulating fracking. The Obama administration appealed to the Tenth Circuit. Oral arguments were scheduled for later this month in the appeals court before a three-judge panel, but the Trump administration asked that they be canceled pending the regulatory repeal. Environmental groups that joined the litigation to defend the rule could ask the court to keep the case active, but the court is not obligated to comply. Once Interior finalizes its action to rescind the rule, it could be subject to litigation, including from environmental groups, states or others affected."
"Former President Obama has reportedly arrived in French Polynesia for a monthlong trip to the South Pacific islands. Obama is staying at an eco-friendly luxury resort near the tourist island of Tahiti, Agence France Presse (AFP) reported, citing local TV channel Tahiti Nui TV. AFP said Obama was at actor Marlon Brando’s privately owned retreat, Tetiaroa atoll. Brando bought the resort in the 1960s, and its villas boast their own plunge pools and cost at least $2,150 a night.  AFP said it is unclear what Obama plans on doing during his stay in French Polynesia, a French territory comprised of more than 100 islands, or if his family will ultimately join him there. Obama made an unannounced trip to Hawaii on Monday, his second there since visits for Christmas and New Year’s. The former president was born in the Aloha State in 1961 and was reportedly spotted at a favorite restaurant there earlier this week. Obama also met with tech industry executives in San Jose, Calif., on Monday, a day after visiting billionaire business magnate Warren Buffett in Omaha, Neb. The Obamas are currently living in the Kalorama neighborhood in Washington, D.C., while their younger daughter, Sasha, finishes high school.

"The Trump administration on Thursday rolled back Obama-era guidance that forbade student loan debt collectors from charging high fees to defaulted borrowers, The Washington Post reported. In a “Dear Colleague” letter, the administration tells agencies that collect on defaulted loan debt to disregard guidance prohibiting them from charging borrowers who default on their payments fees of as much as 16 percent of the loan’s principal and accrued interest. It also says that the initial guidance handed down by the Obama administration in 2015 should have been subjected to public comment before it was issued.  “The department will not require compliance with the interpretations set forth ... without providing prior notice and an opportunity for public comment on the issues,” it continues. The decision to rescind the guidance came two days after the Consumer Federation of America issued a report that finds that the number of people defaulting on their student loan payments is on the rise. The Trump’s administration’s letter affects 7 million people with loans through the Federal Family Education Loan Program that are held by guaranty agencies. Individuals whose debt is held by the Department of Education are not impacted by the decision. The amount owed in student loan debt has surpassed that of credit card debt — about $1.2 trillion.  "
"Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) alleged during a private speech that former President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaSpicer slams media for coverage of Russia, wiretapping claims Ex-intelligence official: Napolitano’s British wiretapping claim ‘didn’t get it right’ Halperin: Media shouldn't be 'combatants trying to beat the people we're covering' MORE is living in Washington to run a secret operation to take down President Trump. “President Obama himself said he was going to stay in Washington until his daughter graduated,” Kelly said at the event in remarks caught on video. “I think we ought to pitch in to let him go someplace else because he’s only there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to run a shadow government that is going to totally upset the new agenda.”  ""Because of the extraordinary interest in Rep. Kelly’s remarks, it is worth clarifying that Rep. Kelly does not believe that President Obama is personally operating a shadow government,"" his office said in the statement. ""He does believe it would be helpful to the new administration if the former president would personally call for an end to all leaks and obstruction by personnel from his administration who currently serve in the Executive Branch under President Trump.""  The statement also noted the Kelly's remarks were delivered to a private audience of Republicans and that he was ""sharing the frustration of everyone in the room over how they believe certain Obama administration holdovers within the federal bureaucracy are attempting to upset President Trump’s agenda.” He was speaking at the Mercer County Republican Party’s annual Lincoln Day dinner. The Obamas are remaining in Washington while their younger daughter Sasha finishes high school. Barack Obama's two-term presidency ended Jan. 20 when Trump was inaugurated. Kelly isn’t alone in suspecting that Obama holdovers are threatening Trump and his agenda. Asked about that notion Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said it was reasonable to believe that some federal employees may be trying to continue the Obama administration’s work. “I think that there’s no question when you have eight years of one party in office, that there are people who stay in government who are affiliated with and continue to espouse the agenda of the previous administration,” Spicer said at his daily press briefing. “I don’t think it should come as any surprise that there are people that burrowed into government during eight years of the last administration and may have believed in that agenda and want to continue to seek it.” Updated at 6:22 p.m. "
"Former President Obama met in Omaha, Neb., on Sunday with billionaire Warren Buffett, according to The Associated Press. Susie Buffett, the daughter of the businessman, joined them for lunch in a private room at the Happy Hollow Club, the AP reported. Susie Buffett told the news service that they spent almost three hours together, but she declined to say what they talked about, noting only that the lunch was not a fundraiser. Obama visited Omaha, the home of Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, last January, while giving speeches following his final State of the Union address. The two men have worked together in the past. Warren Buffett contributed to Obama's campaign and also offered economic policy advice.

Conway suggested in a new interview, without providing evidence, that the Trump campaign may have been monitored in ""any number of ways."" “What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other,” Conway told the Bergen County Record in New Jersey. “You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets.” Conway added that there are “microwaves that turn into cameras” during a discussion of surveillance methods. The discussion comes more than a week after Trump said without evidence that Obama ordered surveillance of Trump Tower during the presidential race. Souza also poked fun at Trump on Monday with a photo of Obama on his cellphone that read: ""Glad he only tweeted out facts with his device."""
"President Trump formally began the process of reviewing the Obama administration’s strict emissions standards for vehicles on Wednesday, telling manufacturers in Michigan that the decision would grow jobs and help their bottom lines. During a speech outside of Detroit, Trump told auto executives and workers that he had reopened an assessment of the feasibility of the emissions standards, which the Obama administration had upheld in January. “We are going to cancel that executive action; we are going to restore the originally scheduled midterm review,” Trump said.  “We are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories. We’re going to be fair.”  Department of Transportation (DOT) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials filed paperwork Wednesday to formally reopen the review the standards, which set a goal of an industry-wide fuel economy standard of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.  That review will reconsider the Obama administration’s January determination that automakers should continue to abide by that standard. The auto industry has opposed that decision and considers the goal too expensive and difficult to reach given Americans' vehicle-buying habits. Trump officials have not committed to rewriting the fuel standards, which would require a formal, lengthy rule-making process. Instead, they have pitched their new review as one designed to fulfill the government’s agreement with auto manufacturers.  “These standards are costly for automakers and the American people,” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement. “We will work with our partners at DOT to take a fresh look to determine if this approach is realistic.” The industry had asked the Obama administration to reconsider the fuel standards, which are central to the former president’s climate change agenda.  As soon as Trump won the presidential election in November, the industry turned its attention to him, pushing him to extend former President Obama’s review of the standards. After Obama officials finalized their review in January, the auto industry asked Trump to reopen it.  “The Trump administration has created an opportunity for decision-makers to reach a thoughtful and coordinated outcome predicated on the best and most current data,” Mitch Bainwol, the president and CEO of the Auto Alliance industry group, said on Wednesday.  “After all, these decisions impact the more than 7 million Americans dependent on autos for employment, as well as the driving public seeking affordable transportation. Our industry is committed to producing even safer and more energy-efficient vehicles in the future and that’s what this process is all about.” Supporters of the standards have warned the Trump administration against undoing the rules. Environmentalists say rolling back the emissions goals will increase pollution that contributes to climate change and public health issues.  “Our cars and trucks are not nearly as clean as they should be, but they're a lot cleaner than they used to be,” said Anna Aurilio, the legislative director at Environment America. “America should be putting cars that burn too much gasoline in the rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, today’s order is a green light to keep making cars that dirty our air, endanger our health and threaten our children's future.” Consumer groups, too, said the action would raise prices and hurt drivers. “A decision to withdraw the standards is nonsensical, as it would merely funnel more money to oil companies at consumers' expense and halt the progress that can be made in both savings for consumers and vehicle efficiency,” said Shannon Baker-Branstetter, the policy counsel for the Consumers Union. But Trump said the action makes good on a campaign promise to help grow America’s manufacturing sector.  In his speech, he painted Detroit and its auto industry as a sector strangled by government regulations, despite an Obama administration effort to save manufactures from a bankruptcy crisis, a push that created thousands of new jobs.  “It’s a great business, but it’s been pretty well hurt here,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""But it’s not going to be hurt for long.”"
"President Trump on Friday joked that he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel might find common ground over allegations of wiretapping by the Obama administration.  “As far as wiretapping by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps,” Trump said during a joint news conference with the German leader Friday, prompting laughs from the room. The president was apparently referring to 2010 WikiLeaks revelations that the National Security Agency under Obama had tapped Merkel’s phone.  But those statements were met with skepticism by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, as well as FBI Director James Comey, who reportedly urged the Justice Department to publicly knock down the allegations. Trump also faced questions about press secretary Sean Spicer's Thursday remarks about allegations that Obama used a British intelligence agency to spy on Trump’s presidential campaign, which he pulled from Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano. That accusation reportedly ignited fury among British lawmakers and intelligence officials, who outright rejected the claim. “We said nothing. All we did was quote a certain, very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn’t make an opinion on it. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox,"" Trump said.  "
"The Senate voted Tuesday to roll back an Obama-era regulation that limits who can be drug tested while applying for unemployment benefits. Senators voted along party lines 51-48 under the Congressional Review Act to cut the rule. The legislation already passed the House and now heads to President Trump's desk, where he is expected to sign it. Under a 2012 law, states can only drug test individuals applying for unemployment benefits if they were previously fired for drug use or work in jobs for which workers are regularly drug tested. The Obama rule specified a list of jobs the could be included under the law.  Republicans have argued the Obama regulation amounted to a federal overreach that limited a state's ability to determine its own drug testing policy. ""As we saw too often, the Obama administration went beyond its legal authority in creating legislation that limits the role of state governments,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellMitch McConnellTop GOP super PAC targets Manchin in first 2018 ad Trump may not last a year, his Supreme Court shouldn't last generations Shutdown politics return to the Senate MORE (R-Ky.) said from the Senate floor. He added that the Labor Department ""should go back to the drawing board."" The Trump administration has also voiced support for getting rid of the rule, arguing its definition of occupations is too narrow and limits a states ability to drug test. But Democrats warn that by nixing the rule lawmakers will be allowing states the ability to randomly drug test workers who through no fault of their own are unemployed, poor or in need of public assistance.

"Former President Obama is predicting a North Carolina win in the NCAA men's basketball championship, according to his official March Madness bracket released Wednesday. The ex-president and avid basketball fan has the Tar Heels facing off against top rival Duke in the men's championship. As for the women's tournament, Obama is predicting a showdown between the University of Connecticut and Notre Dame, with UConn coming out on top. During his presidency, Obama filled out his March Madness brackets each year on ESPN. The sports network reportedly extended the same offer to President Trump, but he turned it down.  ""We heard from many of you that your experiences playing sports have helped you develop confidence, an appreciation for hard work, and a positive outlook despite the ups and downs of life,"" the statement reads. ""In the spirit of good sportsmanship and good citizenship, here are President Obama’s picks for this year’s big dance."" It's not the first time Obama has chosen North Carolina as the eventual winner. He correctly picked the Tar Heels as the national champions in his 2009 bracket — his first as president. Since then, however, the former president hasn't been so lucky. Obama's brackets became a tradition of sorts during his eight years in office. His 2015 brackets for both the men's and women's tournaments belong to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History."
"Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) on Friday called for President Trump to apologize to former President Obama for accusing him of ""wiretapping"" Trump Tower without evidence.  ""I see no indication that's true. It's not a charge that I would ever have ever made, and frankly unless he can produce some pretty compelling proof, then I think President Obama is owed an apology in that regard,"" Cole said. ""If he didn't do it, we shouldn't be reckless in accusations that he did.""   White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Thursday defended Trump, saying: ""The president has already been very clear that he didn’t mean specifically wiretapping. He had it in quotes. So I think to fall back on that is a false premise. That's not what he said. He was very clear when he talked about it yesterday."" Spicer said Trump stood by his claim, though the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier Thursday said it sees ""no indication that Trump Tower was a subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election day 2016."" Trump earlier this month wrote in a series of early-morning tweets that Obama had ""my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower"" during the campaign, calling his predecessor a ""bad (or sick) guy!"""

Trump earlier this month accused his predecessor of ordering surveillance on Trump Tower before the election. In a series of tweets, Trump questioned whether it was legal for a sitting president to be wiretapping a ""race for president prior to an election.""  On Wednesday, Trump defended his unsubstantiated wiretapping claim. “Wiretap covers a lot of different things,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson. “I think you’re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer earlier this week said the president's tweets weren't meant to be taken literally, noting Trump could have been referring to a broad range of surveillance activity.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer last week repeated claims made by a Fox News analyst who accused Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency of aiding Obama in wiretapping Trump Tower.   Trump earlier this month accused Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower before the November election. Obama, through a spokesperson, denied that he or any White House official ordered surveillance."
"President Trump on Saturday touted his push to undo Obama-era regulations, saying he will create task forces across the federal government to identify rules that are “hurting American businesses.” “We announced that we will be reversing an 11th-hour executive action from the previous administration that was threatening thousands of auto jobs in Michigan and across America,” Trump said in his weekly address.  “And I mean threatening. It was very, very sad to see.” During a trip to Michigan on Wednesday, the president vowed to review fuel standard requirements approved by the Environmental Protection Agency before Trump took office. If Trump rescinds the rule, it could loosen controls on carbon dioxide emissions. The announcement was widely hailed by automakers, who have been pushing Trump to kill the measure for weeks. The call to review the requirements is in line with the president’s campaign promise to do away with regulations he deems detrimental to business interests and job growth. He has directed particular scrutiny at the EPA and environmental regulations, and his budget proposal out this week calls for massive cuts to the agency. In his weekly address, Trump touted jobs reports for his first two months in office, saying that nearly a half-million new jobs have been created under his administration. Trump had dismissed the monthly reports as “fiction” when they showed success under Presidnet Obama, but has seemed to reverse that stance since he took office. Trump also called for a new economic model for the U.S., dubbed the “American model,” which would seek to lower tax and regulatory burdens on companies in exchange for promises to create jobs in the country. “This will be a win-win for our companies and for our workers,” he said. “Let’s buy American and hire American. Let’s create jobs in America. Let’s imagine new industries. And let’s build a beautiful future together.”"
