One of the clear consequences of Obama's insistence on a deal with Tehran is perpetuating unprecedented division in the United States: One faction focuses on appeasement of Iran considering that there is no alternative to a nuclear deal, even if it is full of loopholes, and that American-Iranian rapprochement will co-opt the mullahs of Iran, embolden moderates, rein in hardliners, and undermine Iran's regional expansion plans. The other faction sees that the nuclear agreement will not curb the nuclear ambitions of the Iranian theocracy, and that at best, it would delay an Iranian nuclear bomb by a decade. This faction also believes that lifting the sanctions on Iran would practically allow it to execute its nuclear plans, which would launch a nuclear arms race in the Gulf and invalidate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This factions sees that the primary beneficiary of such an outcome would not be the moderate forces but the Revolutionary Guards, they key sponsor of Iran's regional expansion from Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon to Yemen, establishing militias that undermine the states in these countries--mirroring the Islamic State group (ISIS) whose doctrine is the destruction of nation states in the Arab region to establish its caliphate.\nTranslated by Karim Traboulsi\nFollow Raghida Dergham on Twitter: www.twitter.com/raghidadergham\nMore:", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/raghidadergham"], "published": "2015-06-26T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-26T05:39:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
