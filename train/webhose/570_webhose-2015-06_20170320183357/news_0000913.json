The president’s a puppet!” the woman continued. “Stop the lies, stop the lies. He’s an Uncle Tom too. President Obama’s an Uncle Tom too.” \n“Black folks, get off your knees and start praying,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-18T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-20T17:02:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
