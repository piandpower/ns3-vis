AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) | SAUL LOEB via Getty Images reddit \nWASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is heading to Capitol Hill Friday to make a last-minute final plea to House Democrats to support legislation designed to give him fast-track authority over Congress to pass major new trade deals. \nObama will meet with Democrats in a caucus meeting at the Capitol at 9:30 a.m., according to a House Democratic aide. The meeting comes just hours before the House is set to vote on a package of bills that could make or break his negotiations with countries on major trade deals that would encompass over half of the world’s economy, specifically one including 11 Pacific nations. \nThe final battle has come down to whether or not fast-track supporters will have enough votes to pass trade adjustment assistance, TAA, -- legislation that helps workers displaced by trade deals. Many of the Democrats who support giving Obama expedited powers to speed trade deals through Congress without threat of filibuster or amendments, joined forces with Republicans based on the premise that TAA would be passed. But a final coup from progressive Democrats who are enraged with Obama's trade agenda, namely the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are attempting to derail TAA, knowing that in doing so fast-track, known as trade promotion authority will go down with it. \n\"Everything’s in play at this point,\" another House Democratic aide told The Huffington Post of the state of play on votes.
