The baby, a boy, was born in a car en route to the hospital and lived for about 30 minutes , according to The Daily Beast. \nCytotec is a prescription pill used to treat ulcers and induce labor. \nThe social worker told police Jones wanted to terminate her pregnancy because her boyfriend had broken up with her, The Guardian reported. It's unknown when the baby was actually due. \nJones still faces a misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous drug. \n\"As the law currently stands in Georgia, criminal prosecution of a pregnant woman for her own actions against her unborn child does not seem permitted,\" Edwards said in his statement, which cited numerous court rulings to back up his decision. \nEdwards plans to hold a press conference later on Wednesday to discuss the case in detail, the district attorney's office told HuffPost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-10T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-10T21:18:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
