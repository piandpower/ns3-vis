Clementa Pinckney, the state senator who was one of nine people killed in the racially motivated shooting last week in Charleston. Vice President Joe Biden will join Obama at the funeral services, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Monday. The visit will be Obama's first to the city since the deadly shooting last week at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic black church. RELATED: South Carolina lawmakers to address Confederate flag debate The White House will release additional details of the visit in the coming days, Schultz said. The visit will come days spoke candidly about racism in America during an interview for the podcast \"WTF with Marc Maron\" released on Monday -- even using the N-word, a word some consider offensive. \"Racism, we are not cured of it. And it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public,\" Obama said in the interview. \"That's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It's not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don't, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior.\" Obama's visit to Charleston is also notable as he opted earlier this year not to visit Baltimore -- which became the epicenter of the debate over race and policing issues -- as protests unfurled in that city in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died in police custody. Valerie Jarrett, a top adviser to Obama, defended his decision then not to visit the city, saying he would be \"an enormous distraction\" and would pull \"resources away from where they need to be.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> Politics Originals Story by Stephen Collinson and video by Ashley Codianni It wouldn't be the first time a revolution sparked in New England changed the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-22T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-22T23:46:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
