The long-awaited regulation would make workers who earn less than $970 per week, roughly $50,440 per year, automatically eligible to earn overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week, according to Bloomberg . The cutoff under existing rules is around $23,660 per year. The Department of Labor could announce the rules as soon as Tuesday and President Obama is expected to tout the proposal during an event Thursday in La Crosse, Wis., according to the Huffington Post . The White House declined to comment. ADVERTISEMENT The move could raise pay for millions of Americans and is a central part of a White House push launched last year to tackle income inequality. Obama first announced his intention to overhaul federal overtime rules last March. The rules were due this February, but the Labor Department missed its deadline. Under current rules, employees who make more than $455 a week, or $23,660 per year, are considered management and are not eligible for overtime pay. The new rules will be subject to a public comment period and could take effect in 2016. Business groups and Republicans in Congress oppose the change. GOP members of the House Education and Workforce Committee held a hearing earlier this month to blast the rules. Democrats and labor unions have urged the Obama administration to raise the overtime threshold as high as it can.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-30T04:52:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
