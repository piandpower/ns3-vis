Friday morning, the President will stop by the headquarters of Maron's \"WTF with Marc Maron\" interview podcast, located in a garage in Los Angeles. Maron tweeted this Wednesday, hinting at an announcement of the Presidential interview Thursday morning. The podcast was launched in 2009 and has become hugely popular, hosting a litany of celebrities including comedians Jim Gaffigan, Louie C.K., Lena Dunham, Larry Wilmore and the late Robin Williams. Maron is also set to take his audio podcast to a new video format-- hosting an interview show for Vice called \"Vice Portraits\" for the new VICE TV network.
