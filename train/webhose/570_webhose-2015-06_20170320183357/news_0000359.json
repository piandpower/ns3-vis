By Kevin Liptak , CNN White House Producer Updated 2253 GMT (0553 HKT) June 24, 2015 U.S. President Barack Obama speaks about the US government's hostage policy review in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., June 24, 2015. Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama is used to hecklers stopping him during speeches -- but he draws the line when the audience interrupts him in his own house. As Obama was speaking at a White House event honoring LGBT Pride Month on Wednesday, an accented voice rang out from the crowd. Obama wasn't amused. \"Shame on you,\" he told his heckler, who was protesting deportations under the Obama administration. Obama responded, \"Listen you're in my house ... it's not respectful.\" The interruption persisted, however, and Obama asked for the heckler to be removed from the East Room. \"As a general rule I am just fine with a few hecklers. But not when I'm up here in the house,\" he said, as Vice President Joe Biden clapped him on the back. Obama said later if guests are \"eating the hors d'oeuvres and drinking the booze,\" they're typically expected to listen respectfully. Shortly after the incident, an immigration group claimed the protestor was an undocumented immigrant named Jennicet Gutiérrez, who is transgender. According to a press release, Gutiérrez was a founding member of FAMILIA TQLM, established to advocate for LGBTQ immigrants who the group says are often excluded in the immigration debate.
