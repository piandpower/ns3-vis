Under current law, the groups can receive an exemption by writing a letter to the Health and Human Services Department or filling out a two-page form to document their objections. \nBut the groups say those extra steps create an “unjustified substantial burden” and are calling for the same kind of across-the-board exemption that houses of worship receive under the law. ADVERTISEMENT The Supreme Court has asked lower courts to reconsider several decisions given the ruling last year in the Hobby Lobby case, which exempted closely held corporations from ObamaCare’s mandate that employers cover birth control.\nThe Catholic Health Association, though, has praised the Affordable Care Act for providing healthcare to the poor, calling it a Catholic priority. \n“As long-time supporters of a health care system that works for everyone and pays special attention to those who are poor and vulnerable, we are grateful for the President’s leadership on the ACA,” said Sister Carol Keehan, the president and CEO of the Catholic Health Association. \nThe looming Supreme Court case that could invalidate ObamaCare subsidies for an estimated 6.4 million people will also be in the spotlight during the week. \nThe decision is expected in late June, but it is possible that it could be released as soon as Monday. \nOn Capitol Hill, the House Ways and Means Committee is holding a hearing on ObamaCare implementation and the Department of Health and Human Services budget on Wednesday. The hearing could also be another opportunity for lawmakers to grill officials about the subsidies and any backup plans for ObamaCare. \nThe panel’s chairman, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), is leading the House’s contingency planning in case the court strikes down the subsidies. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday cast doubt on whether any congressional response to the ruling could actually make it into law. He said Obama is likely to pressure states to set up their own exchanges so subsidies can continue. \n“What I think he’ll probably do is veto anything we send him and put the pressure on the states to cave and turn established state exchanges in place of federal exchanges, thereby making them eligible for subsidies,” McConnell said on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” \nStates will also be under close watch as some begin preparing for the ruling. Pennsylvania and Delaware this week became the first two states to announce that they will set up their own exchanges if the court strikes down the subsidies in the federal exchanges. \nBoth states have Democratic governors; many Republican governors are far more reluctant. \n\nMcConnell: Obama will veto any ObamaCare backup plan we pass: http://bit.ly/1Gp81qb \nCruz slams Obama officials for refusing to testify: http://bit.ly/1APemsK \nGOP open to extending ObamaCare subsidies: http://bit.ly/1H9rB8I \nSecond state moves to save ObamaCare subsidies: http://bit.ly/1IiaMXK \nObamaCare sign-ups officially beat 2015 goal: http://bit.ly/1KJPyT1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-08T23:29:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
