A group of activists in Europe are planning to fly a drone into Poland to deliver abortion pills. The flight will begin in an eastern German town near the Polish border on Saturday. Its final destination will be announced Friday night.\nOrganizers of the planned delivery, which is a collaboration of a number of different women's rights groups, say in a statement they want to demonstrate the differences between reproductive health policies in Poland and other European countries.\nThey say abortion has been severely restricted in Poland and difficult to obtain.\nAccording to the United Nations, the Polish government allows women to get an abortion if the mother's life is in danger, there is potential damage to the fetus, and in the cases of rape or incest. Procedures cannot be performed on request or for economic or social reasons, which is the case in Germany.\nThe activists also say they are flying in the medical abortion pills, referred to as RU 486, because the drug is not allowed in Poland.\nWomen on Waves and its partners say the drone carrying the package will weigh less than 11 pounds and stay within the pilot's line of sight. The group also says the drone will not fly in any controlled airspace.\nRead next: Major media companies unite to test 'news drones'\nRead next: Is this Chinese drone maker worth $10 billion\n 1:48 PM ET", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150623092410-abortion-drone-780x439.jpg", "http://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/5636/abortion-drone--first-flight-to-poland"], "published": "2015-06-23T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-24T00:32:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
