Romney tweeted Saturday morning that the flag is “ a symbol of racial hatred ” and that South Carolina should “remove it now” to honor the victims of Wednesday’s shooting in Charleston, S.C. Take down the #ConfederateFlag at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) June 20, 2015 Hours later, Obama echoed Romney's sentiments, linking to his tweet with an approving \"Good point, Mitt.\" — President Obama (@POTUS) June 21, 2015 ADVERTISEMENT Romney joins a growing group of politicians calling for the flag’s removal in the wake of the mass shooting in Charleston, S.C., that claimed nine lives on Wednesday. Suspect Dylann Storm Roof, 21, allegedly opened fire on congregants at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Roof allegedly uttered racial epithets before attacking. The White House on Friday said President Obama believes the historic emblem “ belongs in a museum .” The two men engaged in a fierce and touchy battle for the White House in 2012, with Obama emerging victorious. Tension between the two continued in February, with news that Obama was “ irritated ” by Romney’s concession call on Election Night, believing Romney to be crediting his loss solely to the black vote. In a March interview, Romney denied making any racially charged remarks in the call. While campaigning for Republicans in 2014 midterm races, Romney was fond of telling a joke at Obama’s expense.
