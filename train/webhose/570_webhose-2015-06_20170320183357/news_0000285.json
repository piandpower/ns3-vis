Doctors at all clinics also would be forced to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.\nThe clinics said enforcing the new regulations would lead to a second major wave of clinic closures statewide in as many years. Texas had 41 abortion clinics in 2012; 19 remain.\nThe regulations would have left the state with no clinic west of San Antonio. Only one would have been able to operate on a limited basis in the Rio Grande Valley.\nIn November 2013, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that four justices probably would want to review the constitutionality of the regulations.\n \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-29T23:49:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
