Obama hosted leaders from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Amirates and Oman to discuss a range of issues including the Iran nuclear deal. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch - Pool/Getty Images) | Pool via Getty Images reddit \nJERUSALEM (AP) — U.S President Barack Obama reached out to a skeptical Israeli public in an interview aired Monday saying that only an agreement, not military action, can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. \nObama said: \"I can, I think, demonstrate, not based on any hope but on facts and evidence and analysis, that the best way to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon is a verifiable, tough agreement.\" \nObama's remarks come as an end-of-June deadline for an Iranian deal is fast approaching. \n\"A military solution will not fix it. Even if the United States participates, it would temporarily slow down an Iranian nuclear program but it will not eliminate it,\" he said in excerpts from his interview with Israeli Channel 2 TV's investigative program \"Uvda.\" \nThe full interview will be broadcast Tuesday night. \nIsrael has said the emerging nuclear agreement with Iran is a bad deal and that a military option is still on the table to prevent Iran from getting the bomb. Relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been tense at times and the Iran issue has been a source of contention between the traditionally close allies. \nThe proposed deal would freeze Iran's nuclear program for a decade, in return for sanctions relief. Iran insists that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes, while the West fears it could allow it to build nuclear weapons. \nIsrael has long claimed a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a grave threat to world peace and security, and it views a nuclear-armed Tehran as a threat to its very existence, citing Iran's repeated calls for Israel's destruction, its long-range missile program and its support for violent anti-Israel groups like the Hezbollah in Lebanon. \nWhen asked how he would respond if Israel were to act militarily without notifying him, Obama said he \"won't speculate on that.\" \nHe tried to pacify an Israeli public widely skeptical of the deal by saying \"I understand your concerns and I understand your fears.\" Also on HuffPost:   \"I am convinced that if this framework leads to a final, comprehensive deal, it will make our country, our allies, and our world safer. This has been a long time coming,\" Obama said in remarks delivered at the White House Rose Garden. (AP Photo/J. David Ake) “There is no nuclear deal or framework with Iran; there is only a list of dangerous U.S. concessions that will put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons,\" Cotton said in a statement. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) \"I am cautiously optimistic about this framework. We must always remain vigilant about preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon but there is no question that a diplomatic solution is vastly preferable to the alternatives. Now is the time for thoughtful consideration, not rash action that could undermine the prospects for success,\" Reid said in a statement. (AP Photo/John Locher) \"The president says negotiators have cleared the basic threshold needed to continue talks, but the parameters for a final deal represent an alarming departure from the White House’s initial goals. My longtime concerns about the parameters of this potential agreement remain, but my immediate concern is the administration signaling it will provide near-term sanctions relief,\" Boehner said in a statement. (AP Photo/Karim Kadim) \"This framework to roll back Iran’s nuclear program is founded not on trust, but on vigilance and enforcement. Critically, this framework significantly restricts Iran’s enrichment capability and enables us to intensify our vigilance where it is needed most and that is inside Iran’s facilities. The aggressive inspections and restrictions outlined in the preliminary framework offers a strong, long-term plan to stop Iran from building a bomb,\" Pelosi said in a statement. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \"To the detriment of international security--specifically regarding the security of the United States, Israel and other allies, as well as preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East--the Obama administration has always approached the goal of these negotiations as reaching the best deal that is acceptable to Iran, rather than what should be our national goal: ending Iran's nuclear program,\" McConnell said in a statement. (AP Photo/Molly Riley) \"The understanding that the major world powers have reached with Iran is an important step toward a comprehensive agreement that would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and strengthen the security of the United States, Israel, and the region,\" she said in the statement. \"Getting the rest of the way to a final deal by June won't be easy, but it is absolutely crucial. I know well that the devil is always in the details in this kind of negotiation,\" Clinton said in a statement. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) \"The reported details of the Iran deal include significant concessions to a nation whose leaders call for death to America and the destruction of Israel. Iran remains a major destabilizing force in the region, working against American interests,\" Bush said in a statement. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) \"Finding a negotiated solution, something that works, something that doesn't involve trusting, something that involves verifying that Iran is not moving toward developing a nuclear weapon, that is our best promise in the region. And so far, when everyone says they don't like this deal -- not everyone certainly, [but] the people who do say it -- the real question is, 'And what's the alternative here? What have you got as the next best move?'\" Warren said during an appearance on \"The HuffPost Show.\" (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) \"Under no circumstance should a U.S. President lift sanctions and grant nuclear capability to a nation that proudly chants ‘Death to America.' It is unfortunate that throughout these negotiations the President continually reserved his harshest language not for the Iranian regime, but for the United States Congress and the Prime Minister of Israel,\" Cruz said in a statement. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) \"While much more work remains to be done this framework is an important step forward. It is imperative that Iran not get a nuclear weapon. It also is imperative that we do everything we can to reach a diplomatic solution and avoid never-ending war in the Middle East. I look forward to examining the details of this agreement and making sure that it is effective ‎and strong,\" Sanders said in a statement. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) \"We cannot, and should not, divorce our nuclear diplomacy with Iran from the larger strategic challenge that Iran poses. I am concerned about the impact that today’s agreement may have on the growing tensions and conflicts in the Middle East—for as Dr. Henry Kissinger has observed, the Administration’s approach to nuclear diplomacy with Iran has moved from preventing proliferation to managing it,\" McCain said in a statement. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) “This is a very serious issue that deserves careful consideration, and I expect to have a classified briefing in the near future. I strongly believe Congress should have the right to disapprove any agreement and I support the Corker bill which would allow that to occur,” Schumer said in an emailed statement to Politico. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) “A nuclear-armed Iran would lead to a less safe and less secure world, which is why the stakes are so high in the pursuit of a strong agreement that is fully enforceable, verifiable and is in our national security interests. It is important that we wait to see the specific details of today’s announcement, and as the P5-plus-one works toward any final deal, we must remain clear-eyed regarding Iran’s continued resistance to concessions, long history of covert nuclear weapons-related activities, support of terrorism, and its current role in destabilizing the region. If a final agreement is reached, the American people, through their elected representatives, must have the opportunity to weigh in to ensure the deal truly can eliminate the threat of Iran’s nuclear program and hold the regime accountable,\" Corker said in a statement. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) “The United States – executive branch and Congress – are unified in our goal to ensure that Iran is blocked from ever having a nuclear weapon. The best outcome is a strong diplomatic one. This framework and the ultimate agreement cannot be based on trust; there is no trust when it comes to Iran. The final agreement must be verifiable and transparent, making it clear that any violations would result in an immediate restoration of the strongest possible sanctions. Congress has a role to play in this process and I look forward to reviewing all the details of this long-sought agreement that Secretary of State John Kerry and our allies have negotiated,” Cardin said in a statement. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File) \"I am very concerned by the extent of the sanctions relief that this announcement appears to offer Iran. Almost all congressionally-mandated sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program are also related to Tehran's advancing ballistic missile program, intensifying support for international terrorism, and other unconventional weapons programs. And I remain concerned regarding the ability to effectively re-impose sanctions once they have been weakened,\" Royce said in a statement. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) \"Today's announcement is the culmination of months of negotiation and compromise. We now need to take a close look at the details to determine if the compromises made are worth the dismantling of years of pressure built on Iran. As I've said and again, no deal is better than a bad deal, and we need to ensure that this agreement forecloses any pathway to a bomb,\" Engel said in a statement. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) “This attempt to spin diplomatic failure as a success is just the latest example of this administration’s farcical approach to Iran. Under this President’s watch, Iran has expanded its influence in the Middle East, sowing instability throughout the region. Iran’s support for terrorism has continued unabated without a serious response from the United States. The regime’s repression of the Iranian people and its detentions of American citizens continue. And now Tehran is gaining international acceptance of its nuclear ambitions and will receive significant sanctions relief without making serious concessions,\" Rubio said in a statement. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) “I welcome today’s announcement that a framework understanding has been reached between Iran, the United States and our partners in the P5+1, and look forward to reviewing the details of the framework over the coming days. A comprehensive diplomatic agreement remains the best way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and this agreement demonstrates the political will exists to complete a final deal by the July deadline,\" Murphy said in a statement. (AP Photo/Sergei Chuzavkov) \"If I ultimately choose to run, and if I’m honored to be elected by the people of this country, I will pull back on that on January 20, 2017, because the last thing — not just for the region but for this world — we need is a nuclear-armed Iran. It leaves not only problems for Israel, because they want to annihilate Israel, it leaves the problems in the sense that the Saudis, the Jordanians and others are gonna want to have access to their own nuclear weapons…\" Walker told Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) \"I'm encouraged to hear that negotiators have agreed to a framework—a major step toward achieving a final deal. Our shared goal in the United States is clear: to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. The stakes couldn't be higher and I commend Secretary Kerry and our entire negotiating team for their commitment to finding a diplomatic solution that guarantees our security and that of our allies,\" Durbin said in a statement. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \"The Obama Administration's efforts to get a deal at any cost, will have a greater cost than the world can bear. Iranian leaders will now find a nuclear weapon dangerously within reach. Even during these recent negotiations, Iranians have continued to chant \"death to America\". When people show you who they are, it's important to believe them the first time. If this deal moves forward the consequences for the US and our allies in the region will be dire,\" McCaul said in a statement. (AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke) \"Americans want to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and they would prefer to do it through diplomacy rather than military action. This breakthrough agreement is an important step toward that goal. I believe that Congress now should give our negotiators time and space to work out the details of a strong, verifiable comprehensive agreement,\" Franken said in a statement. (AP Photo/Jim Mone) \"Based upon the statements made and press reports, there appears to be major confusion and uncertainty over exactly what the deal entails. There also appears to be major differences of opinion over what impact the deal will have on the Iranian's drive to develop a nuclear weapon. While I will reserve judgment until the details are known, it is notable how far from the White House's initial negotiating principals we appear to be. Given the magnitude of this potential agreement and based on the obvious conflicts in interpretation, it is increasingly imperative Congress review any deal before it is finalized and before congressional sanctions are lifted,\" Graham said in a statement.
