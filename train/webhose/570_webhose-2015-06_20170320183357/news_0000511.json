Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama called the nine deaths in the Charleston, South Carolina church shooting \"senseless murders\" Thursday, and suggested a greater focus on gun control was necessary in the wake of the tragedy. \"Any death of this sort is a tragedy. Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy,\" said Obama, as Vice President Joe Biden stood alongside him. \"There is something particularly heartbreaking about death happening in a place in which we seek solace, we seek peace.\" Obama added that the tragedy should refocus attention on preventing potential killers from getting their hands on guns. \"We do know that once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun,\" Obama said at the White House. \"At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this kind of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency. It is in our power to do something about it.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-18T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-18T19:58:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
