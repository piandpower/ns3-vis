The activists from the Egyutt (Together) opposition party could be fined. \nPrime Minister Viktor Orban's government has been setting up billboards with messages like \"If you come to Hungary, you cannot take away Hungarians' jobs.\" A questionnaire on the issue sent to all voters has been criticized by human rights groups for linking migration to terrorism and attempting to confuse refugees with economic migrants. \nThe billboards are in Hungarian and are unlikely to be understood by migrants or asylum seekers, who have increased in numbers recently although nearly all quickly move further west.
