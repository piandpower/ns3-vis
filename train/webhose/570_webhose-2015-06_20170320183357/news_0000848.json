It's up to her.\" \nOthers were staunchly anti-abortion. Fifteen-year-old Melissa described abortion as \"killing,\" because \"They're basically killing the baby. Even though it's still in the mom.\" Anna, age 20, responded that abortion is \"wrong.\" \n\"I've always been pro-life,\" she said. \"I feel like when people are pro-choice, they always just think of the mom... people don't think about the person that's inside of you, or the life that doesn't have a voice.\" \nTen women interviewed associated the word \"choice\" with abortion. However, the video reminds us that a woman's right to choose is still far from being accepted across the board -- even by women themselves. \nWatch the full video above.
