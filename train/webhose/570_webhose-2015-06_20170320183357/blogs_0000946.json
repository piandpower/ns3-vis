Gay and lesbian couples now have the right to marry, just like anyone else. #LoveWins — President Obama (@POTUS) June 26, 2015 \nObama opposed same-sex marriage when he was first elected president in 2008, before coming out in support of it before the 2012 election. At a White House reception marking LGBT Pride Month, Obama hailed the expansion of gay rights during his presidency. “When I became president, same-sex marriage was legal in only two states. Today, it’s legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia,” he said. “A decade ago, politicians ran against LGBT rights. Today, they’re running towards them.”In a 5-4 ruling, the high court ruled same-sex couples have the right to marry under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. That means that the 14 states that still have bans on same-sex marriage can no longer enforce them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-26T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-26T23:31:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
