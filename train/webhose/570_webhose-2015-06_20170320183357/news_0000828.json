He instead yelled an obscenity and took off in the skiff. A Coast Guard patrol boat did not immediately find him. \nOfficers seized 141 marijuana plants that ranged from seedlings to 3-foot specimens and enough dried marijuana to fill a 55-gallon bag. \nThey also seized grow equipment, a handgun, cash and a bullet-proof vest. \nPolice did not immediately return a phone call Sunday to say whether they have found the man.
