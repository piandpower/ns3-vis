Al-Abadi was expected to press the United States for more equipment he claims is desperately needed to combat ISIS advances. But Obama isn't likely to announce any new assistance to Iraq this weekend, according to the officials, who say the administration is continually assessing its training and equipment shipments to Baghdad. Like in Iraq, Obama has been reluctant to provide lethal aid to Ukrainian troops, currently engaged in some of the fiercest fighting to date in their conflict with Russian-backed separatists. Obama has so far resisted sending arms to the Ukrainians. Vice President Joe Biden, speaking in Washington last month, said the shipments were still under consideration, and senior members of Obama's administration -- including Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey -- have voiced openness to arms shipments. But European leaders, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have fiercely opposed lethal aid out of fear the violence could escalate. Obama was set to meet one-on-one with Merkel after touring a Bavarian village with her on Sunday. Any decision on sending arms to Ukraine appeared unlikely at the two-day G7 meeting, where White House officials say the focus will remain on tightening sanctions on Russia. \"I think our general view is 'steady as she goes' on that front,\" said Charles Kupchan, Obama's senior director for European affairs. \"We've always said that we favor and are pushing toward a diplomatic settlement to the crisis.\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-07T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-07T08:09:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
