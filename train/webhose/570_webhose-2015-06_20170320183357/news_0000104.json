Three of the court's conservative justices, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, said they would have heard the case. Four of the nine justices must agree to hear a case for the court to take it up. \nThe court's action means the October 2014 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the 2006 law is unconstitutional, is the final word in the case. \n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-01T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-01T17:04:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
