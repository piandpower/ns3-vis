But she still faces a misdemeanor charge of dangerous drug possession. The prosecutor said \"Georgia law presently does not permit prosecution of Ms. Jones for any alleged acts related to the end of her pregnancy.\" \nA police report says Jones took four pills to terminate her pregnancy after breaking up with her boyfriend. She was arrested Saturday. \nAbortion-rights advocates and opponents alike were stunned by the murder charge. Georgia has prohibited the prosecution of women for feticide or for performing illegal abortions in cases involving their own pregnancies.
