Listen, you’re in my house,” Obama told the person. ADVERTISEMENT “You’re not going to get a good response from me by interrupting me like this,” Obama said. But the heckler would not let up, despite Obama’s pleas, boos from the crowd and chants of “Obama! Obama!” The president became visibly irritated, and the woman was escorted from the room at his request. “Shame on you, you shouldn’t be doing this,” he said.The protester was identified as Jennicet Gutiérrez by the Not One More Campaign, which opposes the Obama administration’s deportation policies. Gutiérrez, an undocumented transgender woman, could be heard shouting “not one more” and “stop all deportations.” “As a general rule, I am just fine with a few hecklers,” Obama said. “But not when I am up in the house. My attitude is if you’re eating the hors d'oeuvres, you know what I’m saying? And drinking the booze? I know that’s right.”\nTurning back to his speech, Obama touted the gains made for gays and lesbians under his administration and addressed an imminent Supreme Court ruling on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional right. \n\"There are a few decisions coming down in the next few days that I'm paying close attention to,” he said. “However the decision comes down on the marriage issue, one thing is undeniable: there has been an incredible shift in attitudes across the country.” \nHe noted there were two states where gay marriage was legal when he took office, but now there are 37. \nObama said transgender people are increasingly accepted by mainstream America, noting high-profile individuals who have come out and TV shows that \"transgender individuals and families,\" an apparent nod to Caitlyn Jenner. \n“The power of example is slowly changing people’s hearts,” Obama said. \nThis story was updated at 6:12 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-25T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-25T09:12:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
