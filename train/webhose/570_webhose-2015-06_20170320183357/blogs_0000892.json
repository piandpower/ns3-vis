ADVERTISEMENT “A military solution will not fix it, even if the United States participates, it would temporarily slow down an Iranian nuclear program, but it will not eliminate it,\" the president added.\nObama is seeking to allay concerns within Israel, a top United States ally in the Mideast, about his efforts to strike a nuclear pact with Iran. \nHis comments come one month before a deadline to reach a final agreement, which would place limits on Teheran’s nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions relief. \nThe president was asked if he is concerned Israel may launch a strike against Iran’s nuclear sites without first warning the U.S. \n\"I won't speculate on that,\" said Obama. “What I can say is to the Israeli people, I understand your concerns and I understand your fears.\" \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is one of the most vehement critics of the agreement, saying it would leave much of Iran’s nuclear capacity in place and leave his country at risk of attack. \nObama and Netanyahu’s relationship reached a nadir when the Israeli leader leveled those charges in a speech to Congress in March, without giving the White House prior warning about the address. \nDuring a meeting last weekend with GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy (La.), Netanyahu reiterated that he opposes a \"bad deal that paves Iran's path to the bomb, but also fills Iran's coffers with tens of billions of dollars [through sanctions relief] to pursue its aggression throughout the Middle East and around Israel's borders,” according to reports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-01T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-01T23:33:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
