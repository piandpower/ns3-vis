The government began deportation proceedings after he pleaded guilty to an assault charge. \nAn immigration judge ordered him deported. Mata appealed, but his lawyer failed to file paperwork within the 90 days required. A new attorney tried to reopen the case, but the Board of Immigration Appeals refused. \nMata appealed to the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, but the court said it had no authority to order a deadline extension. \nThe Supreme Court said the court did have such authority.
