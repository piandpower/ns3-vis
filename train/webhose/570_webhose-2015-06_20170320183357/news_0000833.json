Graham is generally eyed warily by conservatives for his willingness to compromise with Democrats, his declaration that man-made climate change exists and recent embrace of transgendered individuals . Walker, meanwhile, must reassure conservative skeptics that remember an ad he ran during his 2014 re-election fight touting his support for legislation that \"leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor.\" But the issue holds political peril for the party looking towards the general election, where presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton could use the proposal to exploit an already sizable advantage with female voters. Clinton herself tweeted her opposition to \"a group of senators\" making women's health decisions for them on Thursday afternoon, a reference to Graham's bill. \"A group of senators trying to make medical decisions for millions of women: That isn't leadership—it's malpractice. -H\" she tweeted.

Mark Kirk of Illinois and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire -- in a difficult spot.
