Now the administration wants to expand the disclosure to include any time managers who receive legal advice on the subject. \nThe persuader rule is part of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, which was passed in 1959 to prohibit stealth anti-union campaigns by employers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-01T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-01T16:14:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
