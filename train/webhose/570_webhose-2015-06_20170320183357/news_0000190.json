ADVERTISEMENT Though the decision was widely expected, it nonetheless hands the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) its first major win in defending President Obama’s key executive action to fight climate change.\n“They want us to do something that they candidly acknowledge we have never done before: review the legality of a proposed rule,” Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the opinion on behalf of himself and Judge Thomas Griffith, both appointed by Republican presidents. \n“But a proposed rule is just a proposal,” he continued. \n“In justiciable cases, this Court has authority to review the legality of final agency rules. We do not have authority to review proposed agency rules.” \nJudge Karen Henderson agreed with the ruling, although she wrote a separate opinion arguing that it is within the court’s jurisdiction to review the rule if it wanted to. \nMurray Energy Corp. led a coalition of energy companies in challenging the rule , arguing that the Clean Air Act does not allow the regulation of carbon dioxide from power plants since other emissions from those plants are already regulated. \nWest Virginia led 15 states who also challenged the rule, and the cases were combined. \nThe EPA plans to make the regulation final in August, at which point more court challenges are expected. \nAs proposed last June, the rule would cut the power sector’s carbon emissions 30 percent by 2030.
