Bush took his only departure from his prepared remarks Monday to respond to a group of people heckling him on immigration reform. As Bush introduced his mother to the Miami crowd, Bush shot back. \"The next president will pass meaningful immigration reform so that will be resolved -- not by executive order,\" the former Florida governor said. Bush, like most of the Republican field, has criticized President Barack Obama's reliance on executive orders to shield some undocumented immigrants from deportation. Bush himself has been one of the few GOP hopefuls to embrace a pathway to legal status for those immigrants, though his Republican rivals will almost certainly look to tarnish him with supporting what they deem \"amnesty.\" RELATED: Jeb Bush launches 2016 presidential bid The now-official presidential candidate is asked routinely on the stump about his immigration position, which is expected to be a serious liability among the Republican base.
