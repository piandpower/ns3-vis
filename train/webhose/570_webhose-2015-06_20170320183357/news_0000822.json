The researchers recorded the teens' comments in transcripts and then analyzed them to find the recurring themes. \nThe study found that young people were well aware of the negative health consequences of smoking conventional cigarettes, including having yellow teeth, bad breath and a greater risk of dying of cancer.

But if adolescents had heard anything about e-cigarettes, it was very positive and usually came from family members who had tried e-cigs in an effort to quit smoking conventional cigarettes, she added. \nThere are several possible reasons why teens may view the risks of smoking cigarettes differently than using marijuana or e-cigarettes. One reason involves advertising â€” although the tobacco industry can't advertise on TV, in some print media or in any youth venue, similar restrictions don't apply to e-cigarettes, Halpern-Felsher told Live Science. \nYoung people are seeing e-cigarettes in cool colors and cool flavors. They are also seeing celebrities use them, and that gives these products more exposure and makes them appealing, she said. \nEducation about harms \nA second reason for teens' misperceptions is the lack of standardized educational material in high schools covering the risks of e-cigarette and marijuana use, Halpern-Felsher said. And she said a third reason is the changing policies on marijuana: The legalization of the drug for medicinal or recreational use in some states may be contributing to young people's confusion about its health risks. \nTeens need to realize that e-cigarettes are not harmless, but rather contain hundreds of chemicals that can be absorbed into the body, Halpern-Felsher said. She also said that although e-cigarettes contain lower levels of nicotine than regular cigarettes, their nicotine levels can harm an adolescent's developing brain or, if they are used during pregnancy, pose risks to a developing fetus. \nMoreover, the chemicals used to create their youth-friendly flavors can be dangerous to the heart and lungs when inhaled, she said.
