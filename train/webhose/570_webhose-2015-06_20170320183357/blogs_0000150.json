The president showed up at the annual contest between Republicans and Democrats at Nationals Park in Washington, one day before the House will vote on a series of key trade bills. Obama was spotted inside the Democrats’ dugout with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The president’s surprise appearance at the baseball game caps a day of aggressive lobbying by the White House, aimed at convincing House Democrats to back a program helping workers who lose their jobs because of trade. Democrats usually are more supportive of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), but they see an opportunity to kill fast-track trade legislation by voting against TAA.
