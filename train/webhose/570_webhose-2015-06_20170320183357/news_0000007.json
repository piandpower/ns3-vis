It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency,” Obama said. “And it is in our power to do something about it.” \nObama’s Justice Department is investigating the mass shooting as a hate crime. But as the president addressed the tragedy in the White House briefing room, he also turned to politics -- trying to focus the national conversation not just on race and violence, but gun laws. \nOnce again, the president said, someone who wanted to do harm “had no trouble getting their hands on a gun.” The man arrested in the killings, Dylann Roof, reportedly received a .45-caliber pistol from his father for his 21st birthday in April. \nDespite his raising the issue, Obama seemed aware of the challenge of passing any gun control measures in the current environment, saying “politics” in Washington “foreclose a lot of those avenues right now.” \nSpeaking after previous mass shootings, Obama has on several occasions said more gun laws could help prevent such violence. \nAfter the shooting at the Sandy Hook, Conn., Elementary School in 2012, the Obama administration launched a push with pro-gun control allies in Congress to pass new gun and background check restrictions. The effort failed.
