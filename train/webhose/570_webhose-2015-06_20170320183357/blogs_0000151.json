Burwell – reveal the administration's frustration at the possibility of the court dealing another blow to the healthcare law. ADVERTISEMENT Still, Obama worked to convey confidence that the administration would win the case, insisting that it is \"well documented\" that the authors of the Affordable Care Act didn't intend to block people on federal exchanges from obtaining the subsidies.\nA total of 6.4 million people could lose their subsidies if ObamaCare loses in court – a scenario that the administration has refused to discuss. \nObama again declined to answer questions about his contingency plans for a Supreme Court decision against the law, and said people should \"assume\" that it will be upheld. \nHe did say there was one way to resolve the dispute over the law: \"Congress could fix this whole thing with a one-sentence provision,\" Obama said. \nThat possibility was quickly dispelled by one of the Senate's top Republicans. \nSen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) issued a sharp statement Monday pushing back against Obama's remarks, warning that the GOP would not pass \"a so called 'one-sentence' fake fix.\" Read more here . \nNO SENATE PLAN UNTIL SCOTUS RULING: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday that his chamber will only reveal their ObamaCare backup plan if the court rules against the law. \nThat means that the months-long discussions within a Senate working group on the King v. Burwell may never be disclosed. \n\"If the plaintiff is successful it will require some addressing of the issue, and if that were to happen we'll be ready to announce our proposal,\" McConnell said during an interview with The Joe Elliott Show . \nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said last week that the House will also be waiting to unveil its plan for the court until decision day. \nIf the Obama administration wins in court, Republicans will likely shelve their ideas for a healthcare replacement until debate starts up for 2016.

Just 28 percent of people said they'd be less likely to vote for their representative in Congress if he or she decided to fix the Affordable Care Act to preserve the subsidies. \nA separate poll by The Washington Post -ABC also found that public opinion for ObamaCare is reaching an all-time low. A total of 54 percent of people oppose the law – up six percentage points from the same time last year. Read more here . \nHOW MANY NEW DRUGS WILL $50 BILLION BUY? ONLY TEN : Insurance companies are warning about \"breakthrough\" new drugs that are expected to cost the federal government $49.3 billion over the next 10 years. \nThe drugs would significantly improve treatments for serious conditions like Hepatitis C and breast cancer, but America's Health Insurance Plans warned that it could also set off a dangerous precedent for costs.
