Some are members of the Muslim Brotherhood and others were arrested for violating a demonstration law that the Obama administration says is not aligned with international standards for protecting freedom of assembly. Former President Mohammed Morsi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but after his ouster, the government of current President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi banned the Brotherhood and staged a massive crackdown on the group, killing hundreds and jailing thousands. \nThe Obama administration expressed concern for Egypt's decision to expand the jurisdiction of military courts to try civilians. Human rights organizations say up to 3,000 civilians have been tried in military courts since the decree took effect. \"An unknown number of individuals accused of various crimes have spent extended periods in pretrial detention without charge,\" the report said. \"Conditions in prisons and detention centers are harsh due to overcrowding, physical abuse, inadequate medical care and poor ventilation.\" \nThe report said the Egyptian government has investigated and prosecuted its critics for inciting violence and insulting government institutions or public officials. At the end of last year, at least 12 journalists were behind bars. \"The Egyptian government has also closed media outlets, whose coverage of events does not comport with its narrative, and censored stories that present it in an unfavorable light,\" the report said. \nEarlier this year, el-Sissi OK'd a new law that allows the government to designate groups and individuals deemed a \"threat to national unity\" as terrorists. Critics say the law too broadly defines terrorism to include non-violent acts and could be used to \"stifle all forms of opposition.\" \nMoreover, a new law increases the possible criminal penalty to death for those found guilty of receiving foreign money for activities that endangers the state. Many non-governmental organizations and their partners, which receive foreign funds, are worried that their activities could be targeted. In June 2013, an Egyptian court sentenced 43 NGO employees, including 17 Americans, to prison for illegally operating an unlicensed NGO.
