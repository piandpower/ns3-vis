I was simply making the point that we have to move public opinion. We have to feel a sense of urgency. Ultimately Congress will follow the people. “\nHowever, Obama conceded that “serious gun control legislation” was unlikely in the current political climate. The president also warned that debate on the issue must not demonize law-abiding gun owners, nor should it be suggested that merely having a debate is a “wild-eyed plot to take everybody’s guns away.”\nObama told the conference he couldn't say that the gun control legislation he pushed unsuccessfully earlier in his tenure would have stopped the Charleston shootings, \"but we might still have more Americans with us.\"\n\"You all might have had to attend fewer funerals,\" he told the mayors.\nObama praised actions by mayors from both parties around the country on issues such as the minimum wage, family leave and broader access to preschool as evidence that changes at the local level can make a difference in areas where Congress has declined to advance his priorities. He also urged the mayors to help advance his trade agenda, which has come up against stiff resistance from some Democrats in Congress.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\nTrending in Politics 1 Ex-charity exec who helped expose $500G Clinton Foundation donation faces legal threats 2 Obama renews call for gun control debate after church shootings 3 Company that got millions from US taxpayers now profits Chinese owners 4 Rand Paul pitches plan to 'blow up' tax code 5 IG: Harassment complaints at State Department nearly triple under Clinton, Kerry See all Trends Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-20T04:12:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
