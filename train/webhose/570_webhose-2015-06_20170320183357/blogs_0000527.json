They don’t have any kind of airs. They’re confident but without being cocky.” \nAlthough after Malia was “starting to chafe a little” about the Secret Service, Obama says he had to set her straight. \n“I had to explain to her, ‘Sweetie, let me tell you something. If you think that you’d be over at your friend’s house until 11:30 and then I’d be coming to pick you up, you’re crazy.’ ” \n“So the only reason you’re out is because you got a detail,” Obama says he exclaimed to his teen. “Otherwise, you’d be home because I wouldn’t be chauffeuring you around.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-22T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-22T23:25:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
