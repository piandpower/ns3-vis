(AP) — President Barack Obama and Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton were among the dignitaries set to join Vice President Joe Biden at the funeral Saturday of his eldest son, former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer a week ago. \nObama, accompanied by his family, planned to deliver a eulogy during the Roman Catholic Mass honoring Beau Biden, the White House said. \nBiden's two surviving children, Hunter and Ashley, also were to speak, as was Gen. Ray Odierno, the former top U.S. commander in Iraq, where Beau Biden, 46, once served. \nSt. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church typically seats less than 1,000 people, but portable seats were added for the service. Two hours before the funeral, mourners already were being directed to an overflow room. \nWaiting in line to enter the church, Lisa Rial, 54, reflected on the deep respect she said Delaware's residents have for the Bidens. \n\"Joe Biden is Delaware, and his son is also Delaware to me,\" said Rial, who grew up in Delaware but lives in Pennsylvania. \"They're synonymous with Delaware.\" \nBeau Biden's casket lay in honor in the state Senate chamber on Thursday ahead of a public viewing at St. Anthony on Friday. \nThe vice president, whose wife and daughter were killed in a car crash four decades ago, developed a reputation over the years for possessing a deep ability to comfort those in grief. Often, he is called upon to eulogize fellow American leaders. \nIn 2012, he spoke of his son's service in Iraq as he tried to comfort a group of grieving military families. \n\"When he came home — it's going to sound strange to you — we felt almost a little guilty because he came home,\" Biden said at that time. \"Because there's so many funerals I've attended, so many bases I've visited. And you know, not all losses are equal. Not all losses are equal.\" \nBeau Biden served two terms as attorney general before setting his sights on the governor's mansion. Many imagined his career would mirror that of his father, who represented Delaware for decades in the U.S. Senate before becoming vice president. \nBut in 2010, at age 41, Beau Biden suffered a stroke. He was diagnosed with brain cancer three years later. He returned to work after what doctors said was a successful operation to remove a small lesion, but his illness returned, and he died last Saturday, less than two weeks after being admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. \nHis death drew passionate expressions of sympathy from across the political spectrum, the sense of sadness heightened by the tragedy that the Biden family has endured over the years. It was just weeks after Joe Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972 that Beau, then age 3, and his younger brother, Hunter, were injured in the car crash that killed their mother and infant sister. \nWhite House officials said the choice of Obama to deliver a eulogy reflected the tight personal relationship that Joe Biden and the president have developed after more than six years together in the White House. \n___ \nLederman reported from Washington.

The entire Biden family is saddened beyond words. We know that Beau’s spirit will live on in all of us—especially through his brave wife, Hallie, and two remarkable children, Natalie and Hunter. Beau's life was defined by service to others. As a young lawyer, he worked to establish the rule of law in war-torn Kosovo. A major in the Delaware National Guard, he was an Iraq War veteran and was awarded the Bronze Star. As Delaware’s Attorney General, he fought for the powerless and made it his mission to protect children from abuse. More than his professional accomplishments, Beau measured himself as a husband, father, son and brother. His absolute honor made him a role model for our family. Beau embodied my father's saying that a parent knows success when his child turns out better than he did. In the words of the Biden family: Beau Biden was, quite simply, the finest man any of us have ever known.\" (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \"Michelle and I are grieving tonight. Beau Biden was a friend of ours. His beloved family – Hallie, Natalie, and Hunter – are friends of ours. And Joe and Jill Biden are as good as friends get. Beau took after Joe. He studied the law, like his dad, even choosing the same law school. He chased a life of public service, like his dad, serving in Iraq and as Delaware’s Attorney General. Like his dad, Beau was a good, big-hearted, devoutly Catholic and deeply faithful man, who made a difference in the lives of all he touched – and he lives on in their hearts. But for all that Beau Biden achieved in his life, nothing made him prouder; nothing made him happier; nothing claimed a fuller focus of his love and devotion than his family. Just like his dad. Joe is one of the strongest men we’ve ever known. He’s as strong as they come, and nothing matters to him more than family. It’s one of the things we love about him. And it is a testament to Joe and Jill – to who they are – that Beau lived a life that was full; a life that mattered; a life that reflected their reverence for family. The Bidens have more family than they know. In the Delaware they love. In the Senate Joe reveres. Across this country that he has served for more than forty years. And they have a family right here in the White House, where hundreds of hearts ache tonight – for Hallie, Natalie, and Hunter; for Joe and for Jill; for Beau’s brother, Hunter; his sister, Ashley, and for the entire Biden clan. “I have believed the best of every man,” wrote the poet William Butler Yeats, “And find that to believe it is enough to make a bad man show him at his best or even a good man swing his lantern higher.” Beau Biden believed the best of us all. For him, and for his family, we swing our lanterns higher.\" Michelle and I humbly pray for the good Lord to watch over Beau Biden, and to protect and comfort his family here on Earth.

Met him once, great guy!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2015 (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images) “Beau Biden was a wonderful, strong and courageous man. I met him many times and thought the world of him. His life was so rich and it is unspeakably sad to see him leave us far too soon. Beau’s dedication to public service was deep, broad and profound. He embodied the best and most noble traits that his parents sought to instill in him. I know Joe is very proud and he should be proud because Beau was simply a joy to know. Beau’s wife, Hallie, and children, Natalie and Hunter, have lost a husband and father who was truly one of the good ones and they will be in our loving thoughts as they move through this difficult time. “Joe and Jill are dear friends of mine and I can only imagine what they and their family are going through. Landra and I convey our deepest condolences to them and their entire family in this tragic time.” (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Yesterday Joseph 'Beau' Biden III, a long-time public servant, Iraq War veteran, and the son of Vice President Joe Biden, passed away after a hard-fought battle with brain cancer. Heidi and I were saddened by the news of the loss of Beau, a dedicated husband and father, and a man that so many admired. He tirelessly worked to serve his country. As the parents of two precious little girls, Heidi and I can only imagine the grief of losing a child -- something no parent should have to do. We would like to extend our deepest sympathies and our prayers to Joe and Jill, the entire Biden family, and all those who knew and loved Beau.  Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-06T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-06T17:01:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
