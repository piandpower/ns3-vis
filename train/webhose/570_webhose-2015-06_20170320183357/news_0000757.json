The spokesman said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if Obama and Boehner talked. \n\"We just have to figure out how to untangle the legislative snafu in the House,” Earnest said. ADVERTISEMENT The White House spokesman, though, would not say if Obama spoke to Democratic lawmakers this weekend to sell them on his trade agenda.\nPressed multiple times to identify calls to lawmakers, Earnest declined to do so. He said White House chief of staff Denis McDonough had spoken to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) Monday. \nHouse GOP leaders have not yet decided how to move forward on a package to grant fast-track trade powers to Obama and provide assistance to workers displaced by trade. \nThe House on Friday approved the fast-track measure but defeated the aid program, known as Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). Democrats voted against assistance for workers displaced by trade, a program they have traditionally supported, as a means to defeat the overall package. \nBoth pieces of legislation needed to be approved to reach Obama's desk. \nThe president is seeking fast-track power to finalize the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership. He has pitched it as a trade deal that will open up Asian markets to U.S. products while enforcing strong labor and environmental standards. But many members of his party oppose new trade agreements out of concern they will ship American jobs overseas. \nEchoing comments made Monday by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Earnest said it’s critical to move forward quickly to keep up “momentum” for the proposal. \nSenior White House officials spent the weekend calling members of the House and Senate to find a way forward, Earnest said. He did not provide specifics about those calls but insisted the White House believes the fast-track package will reach Obama's desk. \nWe are \"confident we will be able to navigate this particular procedural snafu and move it across the finish line,\" Earnest said. \nHe also brushed aside suggestions that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton broke with Obama on the trade issue. \nOver the weekend, Clinton urged the president to work with Pelosi to come up with a stronger trade agreement. \nEarnest said Obama’s criteria for judging trade deals is “quite similar” to Clinton’s. \n“She is neither reflexively in favor of trade agreements nor reflexively against trade agreements,” he said. “The overlap in their views is not surprising.” \n— This story was updated at 1:58 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-15T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-15T21:27:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
