(AP) â€” A south Georgia woman has been charged with malice murder in the death of a 5 1/2-month-old fetus she delivered after taking an abortion pill. \nWALB-TV (http://bit.ly/1Irtzju ) reports 23-year-old Kenlissa Jones took a Cytotec abortion pill she purchased on the Internet and delivered the fetus Saturday night. A neighbor drove Jones to the hospital, but she delivered the baby boy in the car. \nOfficials said the boy died after about half an hour at the hospital. Jones was arrested and taken to the Dougherty County Jail. \nDougherty County District Attorney Greg Edwards said the case will likely go before a grand jury. He said Georgia and federal laws will need to be explored. Under Georgia law, no abortions are authorized after the first trimester except in medical facilities.
