Hide Caption 6 of 6 Wilmington, Delaware (CNN) President Barack Obama headed to Delaware on Saturday in a show of compassion for grief-stricken Joe Biden, and to eulogize the vice president's son Beau, who died last week of brain cancer at only 46. Obama was to lead mourners, including the rest of the first family and Bill and Hillary Clinton, along with hundreds of people from Delaware touched by the Biden family's tragic history over the years, at a Roman Catholic funeral mass for Beau Biden. The first person in line for the service arrived at 4:30 a.m., and by breakfast time, the line of mourners stretched around the block of the St. Anthony of Padua Church, in the \"Little Italy\" section of Wilmington, where the Bidens have frequently worshipped. Obama's eulogy will be both a show of respect for Beau Biden, the former Delaware attorney general, with whom he had a personal relationship and a sign of the deep bond that has grown up between the president and his deputy.
