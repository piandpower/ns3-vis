The offense would no longer be a misdemeanor. \nCounty Commissioner Sally Heyman said her measure seeks to spare people a criminal record and would reduce the economic burden on the criminal justice system. \nPaul Armentano is deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. He says similar laws have already been enacted in 14 states.
