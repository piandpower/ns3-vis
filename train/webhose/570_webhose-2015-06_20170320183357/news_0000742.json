Clementa Pinckney, one of nine victims of a massacre at an African-American church. \nIn a personal address that touched on a number of social policies, Obama concluded with the cadence of a preacher — and surprised the 5,500 mourners at TD Arena in Charleston, S.C., by breaking into song, leading the congregation in a rendition of “Amazing Grace.” ADVERTISEMENT The president memorialized each of the nine victims of the shooting but also called the incident a wake-up call for the nation to address not only gun violence, but racial inequality and a broken criminal justice system.\nHe called Pinckney, a personal friend and supporter of Obama’s, a “good man” who “lived by faith” and believed that actions, and not just words, were needed to better his community. \n“It would be a betrayal to everything Rev. Pinckney stood for if we allow ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again,” Obama told the crowd of mourners. \nThe president waded into the controversy surrounding the Confederate flag, calling it a symbol of “systemic oppression and racial subjugation.” \n“For too long, we were blind to the pain that the Confederate flag stirred in too many of our citizens,” Obama said. “By taking down that flag, we express God’s grace.” Obama praised South Carolina’s Republican leaders for removing the flag from state grounds, but said there was much more that needs to be done to heal the nation’s racial wounds. He called on Americans to recognize racial prejudices in their everyday lives, not just overt expressions of racial hatred. “It's not just guarding against racial slurs,” Obama said. “But the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for an interview but not Jamal.\" With members of Congress, including Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), looking on, Obama reiterated his call for stricter gun laws, saying the nation has “been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this nation.” “Sporadically, our eyes are open,” during mass killings, Obama said, listing ones in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; and Charleston. “But I hope we also see that 30 precious lives are cut short by gun violence every single day.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-26T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-26T23:36:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
