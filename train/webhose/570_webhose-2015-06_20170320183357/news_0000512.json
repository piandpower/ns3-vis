This senseless tragedy at a place of worship - where we come together to laugh, love and rejoice in God's name - is absolutely despicable and can never be understood. Tonight we stand together in prayer for Pastor Pinckney and his congregation at Emanuel AME, and for the families who are enduring unimaginable pain at the loss of their loved ones. We will come together as a city and as a state to lift up those who need us most right now. I hope for their sake, and for the people of Charleston, that the perpetrators of this terrible crime are swiftly brought to justice.\" “Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the people of Charleston. We are all heartbroken by this tragedy. “To the families of the victims, please know that you are being prayed for and loved by so many in the community and across the nation. I pray that God will provide you healing in the coming days. “There are bad people in this world who are motivated by hate. Every decent person has been victimized by the hateful, callous disregard for human life shown by the individual who perpetrated these horrible acts. \"Our sense of security and well-being has been robbed and shaken.” \"Michael, Rena, Nalin and I are praying for the victims and families touched by tonight's senseless tragedy at Emanuel AME Church. While we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we'll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another. Please join us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and prayers.\" \"There can be no trying to understand or explain away this evil behavior,\" Jindal said in an interview on CNN. \"I do hope this community will be able to find some comfort in their faith,\" he added. \"Today, the nation mourns as we learn more about the harrowing shooting at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. As law enforcement continues its work and as the victims' families and community begin to heal, we are heartbroken and painfully reminded that our work is far from done. No one should ever have a reason to be afraid to go to their place of worship. We must recommit to ensuring our communities are safe from senseless and hateful acts of violence.\" \"The Charleston church killings are a tragic reminder of the ugly stain of racism that still taints our nation. This senseless violence fills me with outrage, disgust and a deep, deep sadness. The hateful killing of nine people praying inside a church is a horrific reminder that, while we have made significant progress in advancing civil rights in this country, we are far from eradicating racism. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and their congregation.\" “My heart and prayers go out to the entire Charleston community and the families and loved ones of victims in this horrific hate crime, as gun violence again grips our nation. Mass murder and gun violence have killed children and educators in their Sandy Hook school, moviegoers in Colorado, and men and women in their workplaces and neighborhoods across America. Last night gun violence invaded yet another sacred place – a site of ultimate sanctity and safety. We are far beyond saying ‘enough is enough’ and in danger of being numb to the scourge of gun violence plaguing our country. Numbness to gun violence is consummate complicity.\" “The brutal killing of nine innocent African-Americans at the historically black Emmanuel AME Church in South Carolina, including pastor and State Senator Clementa Pinckney, is an unspeakable and horrific tragedy by any measure. These individuals simply gathered to worship and study the Bible in a sanctuary and place of refuge as they did every week, but were senselessly killed. My most heartfelt condolences go out to all of the families and friends of the victims as well as the entire community. “It is my hope that all levels of state, local and federal law enforcement work together to capture this brutal killer before any more senseless violence occurs. I commend the Department of Justice for their swift determination to open a federal hate crimes investigation.” “Like all Americans, Marcelle and I are shaken by the horrific tragedy in Charleston. We all deserve to feel safe regardless of who we are, who we love, or what religion we choose to practice. Our thoughts and prayers are with the grieving families and parishioners whose right to feel safe in their community and their place of worship was taken from them yesterday. “I appreciate the swift engagement by the Department of Justice to monitor the situation and to assist in any way possible. Today, we stand with the people of Charleston and with the brave law enforcement officers and agents who are working to bring to justice the person or persons responsible for these heinous acts.” \"My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of last night's shooting in Charleston, who were tragically taken from us as they gathered together in prayer inside their place of worship. While details are still emerging, I have faith in law enforcement that the perpetrator of this evil and senseless act will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" \"This was an absolutely troubling and heart wrenching moment. The fact is that nine innocent lives are lost. Our hearts go out to the people of Charleston. Our hearts go out to the members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. We in this city feel the pain of people anywhere in this country, anywhere in this globe, because we’re so connected to each and every part of the country and the world. There are so many people here who hail from South Carolina, and it’s a very, very painful moment for all of us. I want everyone to know there’s no place in New York City for this kind of hatred, and that we, through the NYPD, have increase our resources directed at protecting African-American churches in this city as a precaution.\"  Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-18T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-18T21:15:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
