A photo captured Monday shows the president stretching out on a wooden bench, chatting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel with the jagged Bavarian Alps rising in the distance. Obama is closer to Merkel than almost any other world leader, and on Sunday praised her leadership on issues like climate change and the crisis in Ukraine. She, in turn, gave Obama a tour on the traditional village Krun, high in the mountains above Munich. The pair snacked on pretzels and drank tall glasses of beer -- which a local official later revealed was non-alcoholic. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel (C) gestures while chatting with US President Barack Obama sitting on a bench outside the Elmau Castle after a so-called outreach meeting at a G7 summit near Garmisch-Partenkirchen, southern Germany, on June 8, 2015. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-08T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-08T17:35:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
