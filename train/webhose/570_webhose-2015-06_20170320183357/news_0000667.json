(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\nPresident Obama seems to loathe chatting with professional journalists but he relishes at the chance to banter with fringe gadflies -- like the YouTube lady who bathes in breakfast cereal.\nAnd then there's the guy who runs the \"WTF\" podcast -- an acronym for a word I am not allowed to write on this website.\nPresident Obama agreed to a podcast interview with comedian Marc Maron -- a podcast host known for his crude language. But who knew the leader of the free world would be more crude than the host?\nPresident Obama caused jaws to drop across the fruited plain when he uttered the N-word during the interview which was published on Monday. He mentioned the incredibly offensive racial epithet during a conversation over race in the aftermath of the church massacre in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\"Racism, we are not cured of it,\" Obama said. \"And it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say n in public. That's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It's not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don't, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior.\"\nCLICK HERE TO FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE NEWS!\nIf he talks like that in public -- I can only imagine what he says in private.\nIt does not appear that the president’s remarks were off-the-cuff. Based on my interpretation of the podcast, he was cool, calm and measured in his use of the n-word.\nIt was disappointing to say the least to hear such a vulgarity come out of the mouth of the leader of the free world.\nBut there you have it folks – this is man who was supposed to usher in the post-racial America. This is the man who was supposed to unite, not divide.\nWhat President Obama said is indefensible. It soils the dignity of the Oval Office.\nFor goodness sake. He's the president of the United States, not a hip-hop artist.\nTodd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.
