Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, among others, indicated their willingness to have a dialogue with the Chinese over areas of concern.\n“The idea that we’re going to have a frank discussion is almost amusing. The vice president said responsible countries adhere to international law… The Chinese are laughing at him,” Krauthammer said, “The Chinese have about as much respect for international law as the communists and the Nazis, the fascists did in the last century.”\nKrauthammer also said the administration has “given away the game” by choosing dialogue over confrontation, and is giving China the upper hand.\n“Who is the dominant superpower here and who is the supplicant? The weakness of this response is simply astonishing,” Krauthammer said.\nAdvertisement\nTrending in Politics 1 Editor says he owes GOP sources ‘an apology’ after new Gruber emails 2 Not so fast?
