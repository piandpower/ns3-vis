The two Hollywood moguls, who founded the DreamWorks Animation studio, were seen leaving the Beverly Hills hotel where Obama was staying, the trade publication reported . The dinner reportedly occurred soon after Obama left a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at the home of actor and filmmaker Tyler Perry. It was not disclosed to the press traveling with Obama during his four-day West Coast trip. The dinner comes less than a week after Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama hosted an undisclosed party for around 500 guests featuring musical performances from Prince and Stevie Wonder. The White House defended its decision not to put the party on the president’s public schedule, calling it a “private” event the Obamas paid for themselves. Obama also dined privately with Katzenberg following an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in August 2013, Deadline noted. Katzenberg and Spielberg are two of Obama’s biggest financial supporters. During the 2012 election, Katzenberg gave $2 million to the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action and Spielberg kicked in $1 million. Past: 1 day House approves fast-track 218-208...
