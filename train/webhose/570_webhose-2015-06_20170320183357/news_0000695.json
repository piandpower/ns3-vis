Few people expected Obama to become the Preacher-in-Chief. And probably no one thought he would sing. But that's what he did after discussing the importance of the black church's past and the necessity of the community in the future. Obama's words on grace especially -- a core biblical concept -- appeared to move him spontaneously to song. While this is very common among preachers in the black church tradition, it is less common for a President to break out in song mid-sermon. Remembering Sen. Clementa Pinckney 22 photos Remembering Sen. Clementa Pinckney 22 photos President Barack Obama delivers the eulogy for South Carolina state Sen. Clementa Pinckney on Friday, June 26. Pinckney was a pastor at the Charleston, South Carolina, church where he and eight other people were fatally shot on June 17. Pinckney was 41 years old. \"We are here today to remember a man of God who lived by faith,\" Obama said. \"A man who believed in things not seen. A man who believed there were better days ahead, off in the distance. A man of service who persevered knowing full well he would not receive all those things he was promised, because he believed his efforts would provide a better life for those who followed.\" Hide Caption Remembering Sen.

Hide Caption 22 of 22 EXPAND GALLERY After discussing the ongoing fight for racial equality and the role of justice in the historic black church, Obama sang the old Christian hymn \"Amazing Grace\": Amazing grace! How sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now am found; Was blind, but now I see. The song was written in 1779 by English clergyman John Newton, a former slave trader who later became an abolitionist. The hymn was especially poignant in the wake of last week's events, which has seen a spirited nationwide discussion about race. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-30T01:32:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
