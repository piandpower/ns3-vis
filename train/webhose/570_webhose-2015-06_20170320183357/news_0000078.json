ADVERTISEMENT Both countries are closely monitoring the situation, in which Greece and its lenders are racing to solve Greece’s debt by Tuesday, when the country’s central bank has $1.8 billion due to the International Monetary Fund from its bailout, the Associated Press reported .\nThe European Central Bank has so far declined to increase the emergency credit available to Greece. \nMeanwhile, Greeks are conducting a major bank run, trying to withdraw large amounts of cash under a fear that they would lose their money if the banking system collapses, AP said. Many banks’ ATMs ran out of cash Sunday morning. \nGreece is also preparing a referendum for citizens to weigh in on financing proposals. \nIn the phone call with Merkel, Obama also offered his condolences for the German citizens who were killed and injured in a terrorist attack near Sousse, Tunisia on Friday. \nGerman officials have identified at least one citizen who died and one who was injured in the attack, which killed 39 and injured 38 in all.
