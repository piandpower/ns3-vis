ADVERTISEMENT The president called Cameron “to express his condolences over the loss of British life in Tunisia and said that the United States stood firmly by the U.K. during this difficult time,” according to the prime minister’s office. \n“The leaders discussed the importance of working together with countries like Tunisia to tackle the threat posed by Islamist extremism,” Cameron's office said. \nISIS claimed credit for last Friday’s attack on a Tunisian beach resort, which killed 39 people. The group also took responsibility for a bombing that killed 25 people at a Kuwaiti mosque. \nThe strikes prompted concerns that ISIS has bolstered its ability to inspire attacks outside the two countries where it holds territory: Iraq and Syria. \nThe federal government issued a bulletin to local law enforcement agencies warning about the potential of terrorist attacks around the July 4 holiday on the same day as the overseas attacks. \nPress secretary Josh Earnest said Monday there is no “specific, credible intelligence” against U.S. targets on July 4. Instead, he said the move is “part of our standard operating procedure.” \nBut he said lone-wolf style attacks, such as the one in Tunisia, are often the toughest to prevent. He also noted ISIS’ public calls to carry out attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is taking place now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-30T00:45:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
