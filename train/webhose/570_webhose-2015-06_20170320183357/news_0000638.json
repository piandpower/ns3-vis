Meanwhile, Republicans -- led by Rep. Paul Ryan -- have also taken on poverty as an agenda item. Ryan, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, embarked on a listening tour in poor neighborhoods across the country and sought to include poverty-combatting items in the GOP budgets he prepared as chairman of the House Budget panel. Critics complained, however, that government spending programs Ryan's budgets cut -- including job training initiatives -- are actually preventing more Americans from falling into poverty. Ryan defended his plans Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation. \"It's not a function of pumping more money into the same failed system because we'll just get the same failed result. It's rethinking how we actually attack the root causes of poverty. All we do these days effectively is treat the symptoms of poverty,\" Ryan said.
