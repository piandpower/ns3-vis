And it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say n in public,” he said on Marc Maron’s “WTF Podcast.” “That's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It's not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don't, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior.” \nObama also said the United States has made great strides toward eliminating racial discrimination since the days of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s. \n“We've made progress, but more needs to be done,” Earnest agreed. \nEarnest acknowledged it is “understandably notable” that Obama used the word, a nod to the public debate it has spurred. But he said it helped illustrate a point the president has long made. \n“I don’t think he was surprised by” the public reaction, Earnest said. “But I think it has prompted careful consideration of what he said.” \nIt’s not the first time Obama has used the word on the record. It was heard in an audiobook recording of his 1995 memoir, Dreams from My Father , during a passage in which he imitated one of his high-school friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-22T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-22T21:19:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
