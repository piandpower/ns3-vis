Clinton urged all sides to get the \"strongest deal possible,\" and said there should be no deal absent that. \nBut Thursday's interview was the first time she said whether she'd support or oppose the plan on the table. \nThe position came with some caveats -- noting that the trade agenda includes several distinct elements. \nAfter the push nearly derailed last week amid Democratic resistance, the House on Thursday approved the centerpiece measure known as Trade Promotion Authority, a bill giving the president \"fast-track\" authority to push trade deals through Congress. He wants this in order to ink a massive trade pact with Pacific nations known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \nClinton, as secretary of state, had advocated for this deal -- repeatedly. \nBut in her interview with Ralston, she stressed the bill before Congress is a \"process vote\" and not \"the same as TPP.\" She said her qualms about supporting it specifically have to do with a worker-aid measure, known as Trade Adjustment Assistance, that was stripped from the package Thursday. \n\"Right now, I'm focused on getting Trade Adjustment Assistance and I certainly would not vote for it unless I was absolutely confident we would get Trade Adjustment Assistance,\" Clinton said. \nThe measure would give aid to workers displaced by trade. Democrats still demand that the measure be included in the final set of bills, and the White House and congressional leaders are pledging to make sure that happens. \nBut the fact that it's not glued right now to the TPA bill could endanger its prospects as the legislation heads back to the Senate -- where Clinton's comments could fuel resistance to the deal.
