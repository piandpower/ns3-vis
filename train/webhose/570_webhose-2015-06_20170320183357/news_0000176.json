It never happens. \nWhen Obama, Lagarde and Italy's Mario Renzi stand up, so does Abadi – though he is still ignored. Finally, Abadi looks at his watch, his translator lifts his hands in the air and shrugs, and the two walk away.\nThe two eventually got to talk. Obama shortly afterward held a formal sit-down meeting with al-Abadi, who has been pleading for additional international assistance in confronting the Islamic State. \nThe two leaders also met at the White House in April but Monday's meeting was the first between the two after ISIS militants took control of Ramadi.\n  NRA:   2   3 Clinton Family Foundation donated $100G to NYT group same year paper endorsed Hillary 4 Treasury Secretary Lew booed at   5    ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-08T17:41:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
