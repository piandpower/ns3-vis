The guys I play with who are all a lot younger, they sort of pity me and sympathize with me.” \n“They tolerate me, but we all know I’m the weak link on the court — and I don’t like being the weak link,” Obama said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-22T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-23T05:38:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
