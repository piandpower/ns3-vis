Here are a few examples: Fox News: John Cusack: President Obama is 'as bad or worse than' George W. Bush \nRaw Story : John Cusack: Obama is worse than Bush and more conservative than Nixon \nThe Guardian: John Cusack: Barack Obama is 'as bad or worse' than George W Bush \nHere's the full context of what Cusack said: \nWell, Obama has certainly extended and hardened the cement on a lot of Bush’s post-9/11 Terror Inc. policies, so he’s very similar to Bush in every way that way. His domestic policy is a bit different, but when you talk about drones, the American Empire, the NSA, civil liberties, attacks on journalism and whistleblowers, he’s as bad or worse than Bush. He hasn’t started as many wars, but he’s extended the ones we had, and I don’t even think Dick Cheney or Richard Nixon would say the president has the right to unilaterally decide whom he can kill around the world. On Tuesdays, the president can just decide whom he wants to kill, and you know, since 9/11 there are magic words like “terror,” and if you use magic words, you can justify any power grab you want. \nJohn Cusack attends Official Academy Screening of \"Love & Mercy\" hosted by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at The Academy Theatre at Lighthouse International on Thursday in New York City.
