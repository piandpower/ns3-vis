It is in our power to do something about it.\" Obama made a similar pitch in December 2012 after a gunman killed 20 young school chidren and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut. Then, the President invested significant political capital in an attempt to advance gun control legislation through Congress. But his efforts -- combated by pro-gun groups like the National Rifle Association -- were rebuffed in the U.S. Senate during a series of votes in April 2013. He called it \"a pretty shameful day in Washington.\" RELATED: Obama reacts to mass U.S. shootings Since then, though other shootings have occurred, the President has not resurrected the same effort to achieve gun reform, an unlikely prospect with the GOP-controlled Congress. But other Democrats sought to highlight the cause in the wake of Wednesday's events, in which nine African-American parishioners of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church were killed, allegedly by 21-year-old Dylann Roof, who is white. Authorities say they are investigating it as a hate crime. \"How many innocent people in our country, from little children, to church members, to movie theater attendees, how many people do we need to see cut down before we act?\" said Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner for the 2016 presidential nomination, at an unrelated event in Las Vegas. \"In order to make sense of it, we have to be honest. We have to face hard truths about race, violence, guns and division,\" she said. The NRA had no comment on Thursday on the Charleston shooting. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-South Carolina, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday Obama and Clinton were out of line to push for gun reform in the days after the killings. \"Too often in the wake of tragedies like this, advocates on both sides of the debate, use the debate towards their own end,\" Sanford said. \"Moving to a large debate on gun control I don't think is what should come in the immediate aftermath, within 24 hours, of this tragedy taking place.\" Another Democrat seeking the White House declined to use the incident as a means for pushing for reforms. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who despite being a liberal hero on most issues has a more moderate record on gun control. He voted against the landmark gun bill, the Brady Act, in 1993 and has voted to allow guns on Amtrak trains in the past. In 1994, however, he voted in favor of the assault weapons ban. And after the shootings in Newtown, Sanders voted for background checks and an assault weapons ban. On Thursday, Sanders issued a statement calling the Charleston shooting a \"hateful killing\" but did not tie it to a call for gun control. His campaign did not respond to a request for comment from CNN on his position on gun control on Thursday. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> Politics Originals Story by Stephen Collinson and video by Ashley Codianni It wouldn't be the first time a revolution sparked in New England changed the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-19T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-19T01:42:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
