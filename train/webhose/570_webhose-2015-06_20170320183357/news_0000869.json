ADVERTISEMENT The funding question is at the heart of House v. Burwell , a case that is now in the hands of Judge Rosemary Collyer, an appointee of former President George W. Bush.\nCollyer appeared skeptical last week of the administration’s request to dismiss the lawsuit, which House Republicans brought forward to challenge Obama’s use of executive power. \nNow she is requesting more information to help sort out the competing claims. \nCollyer asked for both sides to meet and submit a record of the requests and funding decisions in 2014 around the ObamaCare program, known as section 1402, which makes payments to insurers to help cover expenses associated with low-income households. \nShe asks for the record by June 15, including “any action by Defendant(s) to withdraw the funding request for Section 1402, with supporting documentation.” \nThe administration last week asked Collyer to dismiss the lawsuit. Justice Department attorney Joel McElvain argued the House lacked standing, meaning there is no particular harm to the House and the body is, therefore, ineligible to bring the suit. \nBut Collyer had pressed McElvain about the facts of the spending dispute, indicating that there could be harm to the House if the administration had ignored its funding decisions. \n\"I want to know where you find the appropriation,\" Collyer pressed McElvain last week. \nMcElvain claimed the money did not need to be appropriated separately and that it comes from permanent mandatory funds, a “pre-existing permanent appropriation.” \nCollyer challenged that idea. “There was a request and the House said, no money,” she said. \nIf the funding dispute really is abstract and generalized, “you’re probably right” that the House has no standing, Collyer said. \n“I just can’t decide whether that’s actually a fair statement,” she said. \nThe lawsuit stems from the House’s vote in July to bring the legal action, and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has tied to it to broader objections about Obama’s executive actions in other areas, like immigration, as well. \nThe White House last week said U.S. residents don’t want to revisit disputes from years ago and called the suit “a colossal waste of taxpayer dollars.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-02T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-06-02T01:16:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
