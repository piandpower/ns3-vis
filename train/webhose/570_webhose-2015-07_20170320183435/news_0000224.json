He Also Doesn't Want To Be Blamed For Failure To Get One. Posted: reddit \nWASHINGTON -- As international talks with Iran over its nuclear program enter the eleventh -- and twelfth and thirteenth -- hour, the Obama administration is refusing to heed calls to leave the negotiating table, for two reasons. One is substantive: The administration believes a nuclear deal remains possible. The other is political: the White House is wary that if negotiations falter and it ends up with the blame, there could be serious diplomatic and geopolitical consequences. \n“We have managed the Iranian nuclear issue over the last several years by finding ways to try and put constraints on the Iranians while mobilizing public opinion internationally to our side,” one White House official explained to reporters last Thursday. \n“I think we would be in a stronger position if, and only if, the perception is that the Iranians are the reason why there is no deal,” the official continued, referring to the possibility that negotiators fail to reach an agreement by their self-imposed deadline, which has been extended to July 10. \nIn an effort to avoid being blamed for the potential failure of the talks currently taking place in Vienna, the administration increasingly finds itself operating on two simultaneous, sometimes competing, fronts: inviting criticism at home and in Israel for its perceived acquiescence to Iran, while also earning potential kudos from world actors for its patience. \nAs the White House sees it, there are three potential outcomes for the negotiations. The first, and most preferable, is that a deal is struck that curbs Iran’s nuclear program, opening the country up for inspections while providing sanctions relief in return. During a working cocktail party at the White House with Senate Democrats on Tuesday night, President Barack Obama estimated the odds of reaching such an agreement at “less than 50/50.” \nThe second is that a deal falls apart and the blame is placed on Iran. In that scenario, the administration still holds out hope that the international community, including countries such as Russia and China that are not always friendly to the U.S., would rally with escalated sanctions that could potentially bring Iran “back to the table.” That is all lost in the third, and most disastrous, scenario, in which talks fall apart and the U.S. is perceived to be at fault. In that case, American officials fear international support for the negotiation effort would diminish, and the future sanctions regime and the likelihood of resuscitating talks would be imperiled, if not eliminated entirely. Russia and China would feel less prohibited in providing economic relief to Iran, while Iran would likely restart its largely frozen nuclear program. Neighboring countries would have to recalibrate their strategies, and the prospect of military action would grow more likely. \nSuch an outcome would, the White House official argued, \"precipitate the very crisis in the region that people warn about 15 years from now if there is a deal.\" \n\"We would be in a scenario whereby we were to blame for the collapse of talks,\" the official added. \"Therefore we lose the sanctions which has been the brake on their activities and you have a nuclear crisis potentially on top of the already complex regional dynamics.\" \nOn Capitol Hill, a good number of senators, though probably not the majority, seem to share this view. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has said publicly that he's comfortable giving the president space and time to finalize the deal, even if it means blasting through self-imposed deadlines. Others have similarly argued that time and space are a necessary insurance policy to keep the the talks from failing. \n\"It is so naive to argue for the administration to walk away from the table today because [if they do] the blame will be on our shoulders rather than the Iranians' shoulders. It's an invitation for the sanctions regime to fall apart,\" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told The Huffington Post. \"There is a school of thought that if the negotiations break down you will get a second bite at the apple, that the Iranians will come back to the table later on and negotiate again. That only happens if we are able to reimpose international sanctions. And it is important to remember how long it took us to put together a set of truly international sanctions.\" \nFormer members of the U.S. negotiating team attest that in the event of a no-deal outcome, it would be an uphill battle for the administration to maintain and escalate the international sanctions regime against Iran. \nRichard Nephew, who previously served as a sanctions expert on the U.S. negotiating team, recalled that the process of convincing the international community to cut economic ties with Iran was \"nightmarish in some respects.\" And it wasn’t just Russia and China that made things tough. \n“Frankly, everyone was difficult to bring along, because at the end of the day, we were asking them to sacrifice their economic interests when we had none. We gave up our economic interests in Iran in 1995,\" Nephew said, referring to the year that the U.S. severed all trade relations with Iran. \nBut the administration's efforts to avoid blame in the event of a failed deal aren’t without cost. For every deadline missed or reported concession given, domestic support for the talks weakens. Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), has called for U.S. negotiators to walk away entirely, saying the stakes are too high \"for this diplomatic charade to continue.\" Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) has accused the administration of believing that \"any deal is better than no deal.\" \nAnd privately, foreign policy aides scoff at the administration's seemingly never-ending patience. If the White House wants to ensure it won't be blamed for the talks devolving, \"they've already met that threshold,\" said one Democratic Hill staffer. Despite the worst assumptions of its critics, the administration insists that there are conditions it simply will not give up in the talks, such as intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the ability to quickly re-impose sanctions in the event of an Iranian violation of the deal. The White House has calculated that it can afford to bleed congressional support in the short term if it means positioning itself better for a post-negotiations public relations fallout. Though lawmakers will be granted the opportunity to review and vote on any deal that is reached, it seems very likely that the president will have the congressional support to sustain a veto of a disapproval vote. \nIn a strange way, the more the White House resists calls to leave the negotiating table, the better its hand gets for the future blame-game wars if no deal is reached, since it will be difficult for critics to pin the failure of negotiations on a party that rigidly defied political pressure to call those negotiations off. \nThis story has been updated to include Obama's Tuesday comments about the odds of reaching an agreement.

This has been a long time coming,\" Obama said in remarks delivered at the White House Rose Garden. (AP Photo/J. David Ake) “There is no nuclear deal or framework with Iran; there is only a list of dangerous U.S. concessions that will put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons,\" Cotton said in a statement. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) \"I am cautiously optimistic about this framework. We must always remain vigilant about preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon but there is no question that a diplomatic solution is vastly preferable to the alternatives. Now is the time for thoughtful consideration, not rash action that could undermine the prospects for success,\" Reid said in a statement. (AP Photo/John Locher) \"The president says negotiators have cleared the basic threshold needed to continue talks, but the parameters for a final deal represent an alarming departure from the White House’s initial goals. My longtime concerns about the parameters of this potential agreement remain, but my immediate concern is the administration signaling it will provide near-term sanctions relief,\" Boehner said in a statement. (AP Photo/Karim Kadim) \"This framework to roll back Iran’s nuclear program is founded not on trust, but on vigilance and enforcement. Critically, this framework significantly restricts Iran’s enrichment capability and enables us to intensify our vigilance where it is needed most and that is inside Iran’s facilities. The aggressive inspections and restrictions outlined in the preliminary framework offers a strong, long-term plan to stop Iran from building a bomb,\" Pelosi said in a statement. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \"To the detriment of international security--specifically regarding the security of the United States, Israel and other allies, as well as preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East--the Obama administration has always approached the goal of these negotiations as reaching the best deal that is acceptable to Iran, rather than what should be our national goal: ending Iran's nuclear program,\" McConnell said in a statement. (AP Photo/Molly Riley) \"The understanding that the major world powers have reached with Iran is an important step toward a comprehensive agreement that would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and strengthen the security of the United States, Israel, and the region,\" she said in the statement. \"Getting the rest of the way to a final deal by June won't be easy, but it is absolutely crucial. I know well that the devil is always in the details in this kind of negotiation,\" Clinton said in a statement. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) \"The reported details of the Iran deal include significant concessions to a nation whose leaders call for death to America and the destruction of Israel. Iran remains a major destabilizing force in the region, working against American interests,\" Bush said in a statement. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) \"Finding a negotiated solution, something that works, something that doesn't involve trusting, something that involves verifying that Iran is not moving toward developing a nuclear weapon, that is our best promise in the region. And so far, when everyone says they don't like this deal -- not everyone certainly, [but] the people who do say it -- the real question is, 'And what's the alternative here? What have you got as the next best move?'\" Warren said during an appearance on \"The HuffPost Show.\" (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) \"Under no circumstance should a U.S. President lift sanctions and grant nuclear capability to a nation that proudly chants ‘Death to America.' It is unfortunate that throughout these negotiations the President continually reserved his harshest language not for the Iranian regime, but for the United States Congress and the Prime Minister of Israel,\" Cruz said in a statement. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) \"While much more work remains to be done this framework is an important step forward. It is imperative that Iran not get a nuclear weapon. It also is imperative that we do everything we can to reach a diplomatic solution and avoid never-ending war in the Middle East. I look forward to examining the details of this agreement and making sure that it is effective ‎and strong,\" Sanders said in a statement. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) \"We cannot, and should not, divorce our nuclear diplomacy with Iran from the larger strategic challenge that Iran poses. I am concerned about the impact that today’s agreement may have on the growing tensions and conflicts in the Middle East—for as Dr. Henry Kissinger has observed, the Administration’s approach to nuclear diplomacy with Iran has moved from preventing proliferation to managing it,\" McCain said in a statement. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) “This is a very serious issue that deserves careful consideration, and I expect to have a classified briefing in the near future. I strongly believe Congress should have the right to disapprove any agreement and I support the Corker bill which would allow that to occur,” Schumer said in an emailed statement to Politico. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) “A nuclear-armed Iran would lead to a less safe and less secure world, which is why the stakes are so high in the pursuit of a strong agreement that is fully enforceable, verifiable and is in our national security interests. It is important that we wait to see the specific details of today’s announcement, and as the P5-plus-one works toward any final deal, we must remain clear-eyed regarding Iran’s continued resistance to concessions, long history of covert nuclear weapons-related activities, support of terrorism, and its current role in destabilizing the region. If a final agreement is reached, the American people, through their elected representatives, must have the opportunity to weigh in to ensure the deal truly can eliminate the threat of Iran’s nuclear program and hold the regime accountable,\" Corker said in a statement. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) “The United States – executive branch and Congress – are unified in our goal to ensure that Iran is blocked from ever having a nuclear weapon. The best outcome is a strong diplomatic one. This framework and the ultimate agreement cannot be based on trust; there is no trust when it comes to Iran. The final agreement must be verifiable and transparent, making it clear that any violations would result in an immediate restoration of the strongest possible sanctions. Congress has a role to play in this process and I look forward to reviewing all the details of this long-sought agreement that Secretary of State John Kerry and our allies have negotiated,” Cardin said in a statement. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File) \"I am very concerned by the extent of the sanctions relief that this announcement appears to offer Iran. Almost all congressionally-mandated sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program are also related to Tehran's advancing ballistic missile program, intensifying support for international terrorism, and other unconventional weapons programs. And I remain concerned regarding the ability to effectively re-impose sanctions once they have been weakened,\" Royce said in a statement. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) \"Today's announcement is the culmination of months of negotiation and compromise. We now need to take a close look at the details to determine if the compromises made are worth the dismantling of years of pressure built on Iran. As I've said and again, no deal is better than a bad deal, and we need to ensure that this agreement forecloses any pathway to a bomb,\" Engel said in a statement. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) “This attempt to spin diplomatic failure as a success is just the latest example of this administration’s farcical approach to Iran. Under this President’s watch, Iran has expanded its influence in the Middle East, sowing instability throughout the region. Iran’s support for terrorism has continued unabated without a serious response from the United States. The regime’s repression of the Iranian people and its detentions of American citizens continue. And now Tehran is gaining international acceptance of its nuclear ambitions and will receive significant sanctions relief without making serious concessions,\" Rubio said in a statement. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) “I welcome today’s announcement that a framework understanding has been reached between Iran, the United States and our partners in the P5+1, and look forward to reviewing the details of the framework over the coming days. A comprehensive diplomatic agreement remains the best way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and this agreement demonstrates the political will exists to complete a final deal by the July deadline,\" Murphy said in a statement. (AP Photo/Sergei Chuzavkov) \"If I ultimately choose to run, and if I’m honored to be elected by the people of this country, I will pull back on that on January 20, 2017, because the last thing — not just for the region but for this world — we need is a nuclear-armed Iran. It leaves not only problems for Israel, because they want to annihilate Israel, it leaves the problems in the sense that the Saudis, the Jordanians and others are gonna want to have access to their own nuclear weapons…\" Walker told Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) \"I'm encouraged to hear that negotiators have agreed to a framework—a major step toward achieving a final deal. Our shared goal in the United States is clear: to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. The stakes couldn't be higher and I commend Secretary Kerry and our entire negotiating team for their commitment to finding a diplomatic solution that guarantees our security and that of our allies,\" Durbin said in a statement. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \"The Obama Administration's efforts to get a deal at any cost, will have a greater cost than the world can bear. Iranian leaders will now find a nuclear weapon dangerously within reach. Even during these recent negotiations, Iranians have continued to chant \"death to America\". When people show you who they are, it's important to believe them the first time. If this deal moves forward the consequences for the US and our allies in the region will be dire,\" McCaul said in a statement. (AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke) \"Americans want to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and they would prefer to do it through diplomacy rather than military action. This breakthrough agreement is an important step toward that goal. I believe that Congress now should give our negotiators time and space to work out the details of a strong, verifiable comprehensive agreement,\" Franken said in a statement. (AP Photo/Jim Mone) \"Based upon the statements made and press reports, there appears to be major confusion and uncertainty over exactly what the deal entails. There also appears to be major differences of opinion over what impact the deal will have on the Iranian's drive to develop a nuclear weapon. While I will reserve judgment until the details are known, it is notable how far from the White House's initial negotiating principals we appear to be. Given the magnitude of this potential agreement and based on the obvious conflicts in interpretation, it is increasingly imperative Congress review any deal before it is finalized and before congressional sanctions are lifted,\" Graham said in a statement.
