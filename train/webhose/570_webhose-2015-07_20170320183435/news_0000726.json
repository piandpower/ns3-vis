That's why we got to make sure we do right by them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T18:40:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
