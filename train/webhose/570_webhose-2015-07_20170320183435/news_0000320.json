And I care that our commander in chief is more concerned with Muslim sensitivity than the honor and sacrifice made by these Marines.\" \nAnd this: \n\"I've had it with this failed strategy. This half-way, half-baked, tip-toe, be-friendly-to-jihadis mentality pushed by this administration.\" \nLahren's commentary caught the attention of Obama critics in politics and the media as well. She went on Fox News on Tuesday to discuss her remarks. Blessed to share my message on @foxandfriends this morning!
