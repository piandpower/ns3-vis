We honor their service. We offer our gratitude to the police officers and first responders who stopped the rampage and saved lives,” Obama said in a presidential proclamation released Tuesday.\n“We draw strength from yet another American community that has come together with an unmistakable message to those who would try to do us harm: We do not give into fear. You cannot divide us. And you will not change our way of life.” \nAhead of the decision, conservatives lined up to pan the president for failing to lower the flag. They noted that various governors around the country have done so and that the White House had lowered its flag after other mass shootings. \nRep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), the chairman of the House Armed Service Committee, issued a statement earlier Tuesday asking Obama to do the “right thing” by lowering the flag. And Rep. Duncan Hunter, a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, panned Obama as well. \n“Five service members were killed on American soil, and the idea that the Commander in Chief is so far unwilling to lower flags in their honor is unconscionable,” he said. \n“The flag and all it represents is sacred to our military, and the President must know that lowering the flag is a signal of honor and respect. The President should make this call immediately.” \nMarcus Luttrell, a retired Navy SEAL whose story became the bestselling book Lone Survivor and a movie with Mark Wahlberg, also took to Facebook on Monday night to call on the president to lower the flag. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T19:57:57.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
