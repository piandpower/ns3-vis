I think everybody, deep down, is uncomfortable with abortion,” Rose told FoxNews.com. “Everybody, when they’re honest with themselves is uncomfortable with abortion because of the sense that it’s doing something destructive.” \nReactions were divided on the story, first picked up by several news outlets in late June, with some likening the fundraiser to holding the unborn fetus for ransom. But groups on both sides of the debate agreed that it seemed unnecessary. \n\"This type of publicity stunt doesn't change the fact that one in three women will have an abortion in her lifetime, which is why it is so critical that all women have access to comprehensive, affordable, and safe reproductive health care,\" Sonia Ossorio, president of the National Organization for Women in New York City, told FoxNews.com in an email.
