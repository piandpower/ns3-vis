Sam Levine Associate Politics Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 07/15/2015 \nWASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama said on Wednesday that \"there was no precedent\" for revoking Bill Cosby's Presidential Medal Of Freedom after multiple women have come forward and accused the comedian of raping them. \n\"There's no precedent for revoking a medal,\" Obama said during a press conference at the White House. \"We don't have that mechanism.\" \nA White House petition calling on Obama to revoke the medal had earned over 10,000 signatures by Wednesday afternoon. Multiple women have come forward and said that Cosby drugged and raped them decades ago -- allegations that Cosby has denied. The Los Angeles Police Department said earlier this month that it had opened an investigation into sexual assault allegations against Cosby. Documents from a 2005 civil lawsuit against Cosby released earlier this month seem to indicate that Cosby admitted obtaining quaaludes to give to women that he wanted to have sex with. \nWhile Obama said that he did not want to comment on an ongoing investigation, he said that any civilized country should have no tolerance for rape. \n\"If you give a woman, or a man for that matter, without his or her knowledge, a drug, and then have sex with that person without their consent, that's rape,\" Obama said. \"And this country, any civilized country, should have no tolerance for rape.\" \nCosby was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the country's highest civilian honor, in 2002. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:06:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
