The two nations have also agreed to re-establish formal diplomatic relations. ADVERTISEMENT The move is a major step in the countries’ efforts to end hostilities that date back to the Cold War. \nThe Obama administration cleared the biggest obstacle to the shift after it formally dropped Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in May. \nBut U.S. and Cuban negotiators still had to work through thorny issues, such as freedom of movement of American diplomats in Cuba and their ability to speak with people outside of the government. \nAnticipation for the move built earlier this month after flagpoles were installed at the U.S. and Cuban interest sections, which have served as the countries’ informal diplomatic missions. \nObama and Cuban President Raúl Castro agreed last December to begin restoring long-broken ties between their two countries. \nThe two leaders met in April in Panama, the most significant interaction between U.S. and Cuban leaders in five decades. \nEnding the policy of isolation against Cuba is a major foreign policy goal for Obama, who was elected president promising to use to diplomacy to change the U.S.’s relationship with its allies and enemies alike. \nBut many obstacles remain. Leaders in Congress are opposed to lifting the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba and U.S. officials continue to voice concern about Cuba’s human-rights record. \nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a 2016 presidential candidate, has pledged to block any ambassador nominee from getting a confirmation vote. \nCritics of the administration’s Cuba policy condemned the move, citing the Cuban government’s ongoing suppression of political dissidents. \n“There was little doubt that the Obama administration would pursue its goal of opening an embassy in Cuba no matter the sad reality on the ground,” said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R), a Cuban-American who represents the Miami area. “Opening the American embassy in Cuba will do nothing to help the Cuban people and is just another trivial attempt for President Obama to go legacy shopping.” \nThis story was updated at 6:22 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T05:30:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
