The truth is that Islamic radicals live among us, waiting to wage jihad against the infidels - folks like you and me. \nWe all know what went down in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was the same thing that went down at Fort Hood and the Boston Marathon and the same thing that went down on 9/11. Americans murdered by a Muslim - on American soil. \nFour unarmed Marines gunned down in cold blood by a man named Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez. Investigators connected the dots and labeled the attack as \"domestic terrorism.\" \nBut President Obama doesn't seem to think there are any dots to connect. He said what happened in the Scenic City was the act of a lone gunman - \"a heartbreaking circumstance. \" \"It is a heartbreaking circumstance\" — @POTUS on the shooting in Chattanooga https://t.co/sS7cQen0Qj — The White House (@WhiteHouse) July 17, 2015 \nNot once did he mention the words \"radical Islam.\" Not once did he mention \"jihad\" or \"terrorism.\" \nWhat happened in Chattanooga was an act of war But how can we fight a war on terror when our Commander-in-Chief won't even acknowledge who the enemy is - or that we even have one? \n\nWatch Todd Starnes' American Dispatch above and sound off!
