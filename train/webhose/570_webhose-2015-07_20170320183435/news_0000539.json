ADVERTISEMENT \"We're going with the ones that are probably going to have the most success soonest,\" Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd told CBC. \"Energy East has some promise and so does Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain. Those are the two right now to put our energies into.\"\nKeystone would carry oil from Alberta’s tar sands region to the Gulf of Mexico through the United States. American approval of the pipeline is long-delayed, and the State Department is currently considering the project ahead of an up-or-down decision from the Obama administration. \nThe project has become a touchstone topic for environmentalists, and a decision on the pipeline is a long-simmering political issue. McCuaig-Boyd said the fight is too politicized for her government to bother wading into. \n“I think with the election coming and a few others things, it's in their hands more than ours,” she said. \nIn May, Alberta voters elected a left-wing government whose premier, Rachel Notley, said she would focus on environmental issues more than past officials. \nAlberta’s former premier, Jim Prentice, had pushed both the Canadian government and the Obama administration on Keystone, but Notley promised during her campaign to stop lobbying on the issue.
