Obama is the first sitting U.S. president to visit both countries. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)\nPresident Obama said he had been \"most frustrated and most stymied\" by the failure to pass gun control legislation during his administration in an interview broadcast Thursday.\nThe BBC interview aired hours before a gunman killed two people and injured seven others in a Lafayette, La. movie theater before turning the gun on himself.\nObama said the inability to move what he called \"commonsense gun safety laws\" through Congress, \"even in the face of repeated mass killings\" was \"distressing.\"\n\"If you look at the number of Americans killed since 9/11 by terrorism, it's less than 100. If you look at the number that have been killed by gun violence, it's in the tens of thousands,\" said Obama, who later vowed he would continue trying to pass legislation.\nObama was speaking ahead of a trip to Kenya, his first visit to his father's homeland since becoming president.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nClick for more from the BBC.\nAdvertisement\nTrending in Politics 1 Bowe Bergdahl found during California pot raid, released by officials 2 Seattle sees fallout from $15 minimum wage, as other cities follow suit 3 Obama expresses frustration over gun control debate in interview 4 ISIS netted up to $1B in cash after taking over Mosul, US official says 5 House OKs bill to crack down on 'sanctuary cities,' White House threatens veto See all Trends Advertisement", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33646704"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T08:45:38.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
