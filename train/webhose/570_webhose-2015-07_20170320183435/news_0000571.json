Abortion rights supporters have called it the most restrictive abortion law in the country.\nThe law was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature in 2013, though it was quickly put on hold after North Dakota's lone abortion clinic filed a lawsuit that July.\nThe measure was among four anti-abortion bills that Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple signed into law that year with overwhelming support from lawmakers.", "external_links": ["http://www.ap.org/"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T19:08:53.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
