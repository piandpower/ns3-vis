By BruceRubin | Posted 10 hours ago \nCNN PRODUCER NOTE \nIT IS WHAT IT IS. MEXICO IS NOT A POOR COUNTRY. IT RANKS IN THE TOP 15 IN NATIONAL ECONOMIES AND IT'S LACK OF CONCERN ABOUT ITS POOREST CITIZENS HAS BECOME AN ECONOMIC THREAT TO THE US ECONOMY AND REALLY IS A FASCIST ACTION ON THE PART OF THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. WE ALL KNOW TRUMP IS A DUFUS HOWEVER, A COUNTRY THAT REALLY IS NOT THAT BAD OFF DUMPING ITS POOR ON ITS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR IS NOT RIGHT AND DON'T BLAME THE POOR!!! WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO HELP THESE PEOPLE AND SHOULD TAKE A BIG UNCLE SAM BEAR SWIPE AT THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. I WOULD SUGGEST SUING MEXICO BECAUSE MEXICO IS NOT A POOR COUNTRY.
