He was joined by his counterterrorism and homeland security adviser and the FBI director. \n\"As we have more information, we'll let the public know, but in the meantime I'd ask all Americans to pray for the families who are grief stricken at this point, and I want everybody to understand we will be thorough and prompt in figuring out exactly what happened,\" he said. \nAttorney General Loretta Lynch also said in a statement that she's ordered the FBI to take the lead in the national security investigation, and DOJ prosecutors are \"actively involved.\" \n\"I offer my heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the loved ones of the U.S. servicemembers who were murdered and the law enforcement officer who was wounded in this shameful and cowardly act of violence,\" she said. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
