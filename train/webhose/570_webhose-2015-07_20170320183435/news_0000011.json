They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.\"\nClinton said Republicans were “all in the same general area” -- essentially not wanting to give a path to citizenship to immigrants already living illegally in the United States.\nAdvertisement\nTrending in Politics 1 PGA moving tournament from Trump golf course in latest fallout 2 California lawmaker moves to crack down on sanctuary cities in wake of murder 3 US Army plans to cut 40,000 troops over next two years 4 Officials: US jets scramble to intercept Russian bombers off California, Alaska coasts on July 4 5 Shooting renews scrutiny on 'sanctuary'-backing San Francisco sheriff See all Trends Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:51:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
