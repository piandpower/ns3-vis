So why the change? \nWith the killing of the 32 year old woman in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported 5 times, immigration reform and sanctuary city policies will for sure be a hot topic for the upcoming presidential debates. \nIt goes to show that a single event can change the political conversation on a dime .. and how the candidates respond to it .. could determine their political fate. \nGretchen Carlson currently serves as anchor of FOX News Channel's (FNC) \"The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson\" (weekdays 2-3PM/ET) .
