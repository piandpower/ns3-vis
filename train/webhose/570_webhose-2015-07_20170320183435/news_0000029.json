While the United Nations will take care of implementing parts of the deal, the administration still is seeking approval from Congress, where many lawmakers remain skeptical. \nRepublicans, and some Democrats, are concerned the deal legitimizes Iran's nuclear program and gives them too much in return for tightening up the possible paths to a bomb. \nBut Obama argues the deal is far better than the alternative and is urging Congress to give it a chance. On Tuesday, he threatened to veto any attempt to block the international agreement.
