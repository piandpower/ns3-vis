Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) tells The Hill's Molly K. Hooper in an on-camera interview. ADVERTISEMENT Original co-sponsors of the Senate bill include GOP presidential contender Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden (Ore.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Patty Murray (Wash.) and Michael Bennet (Colo.).\nPerlmutter's colleague, Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.), says that \"a year or two ago all we were getting was giggles and titters” about the bill. \n“The fact of the matter is the Senate has now introduced a bill with broad bipartisan support. ... They are sensing that this is something that has to be dealt with and they are trying to get with the program frankly.\" \nTo hear Perlmutter and Heck discuss the measure, please watch the video above.
