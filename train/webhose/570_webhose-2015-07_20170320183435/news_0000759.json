Trump is wrong on this.\" \nBush's wife was born in Mexico, and when he was asked if he took Trump's remarks personally, he responded: \"Yeah, of course. Absolutely. And a lot of other people as well.\" \nWhen Trump announced his presidential bid last month, he criticized Mexico and immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally. \"They're bringing drugs,\" he said. \"They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\" \nIn spite of earlier criticism from Bush and other Republicans and companies moving to cut business ties to Trump, the real estate mogul has defended his remarks.
