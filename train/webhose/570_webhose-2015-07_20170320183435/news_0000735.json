They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.\" \nClinton said Republicans were “all in the same general area” -- essentially not wanting to give a path to citizenship to immigrants already living illegally in the United States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:39:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
