He traveled to Kenya as a U.S. senator but has not gone since winning the White House. \nObama is expected to meet with family members while in Nairobi, but he will not be traveling to the village most closely associated with his family name. \nThe trip will focus otherwise on security and economic initiatives as the president shores up his legacy on the African continent. ASSOCIATED PRESS \nObama will also do some lobbying of lawmakers who are coming along for the visit. The president is seeking support from Congress for a deal to curb Iran's nuclear program. \nThe White House released a list of 10 lawmakers flying with Obama on Air Force One including nine Democrats and one Republican, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona. \nThe Democrats are Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Representative Karen Bass of California, Representative G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, Representative Barbara Lee of California, Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, Representative Charles Rangel of New York, and Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama. \nOn the return flight to the United States, a second group of 10 Democratic representatives will join Obama, the White House said.
