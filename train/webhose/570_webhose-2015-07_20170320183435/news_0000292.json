Smyer is the former provost and a current professor of psychology at Bucknell University, and the founder of Graying Green: Climate Communication for an Aging World . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) The world's population is aging at the very time that immediate action on climate change has become crucially important. And we ignore the shared link between these two global patterns at our own risk. Consider: The number of people 60 and older on Earth has doubled since 1980 , and is forecast to reach 2 billion by 2050 -- jumping from 11% to 22% of the total population during the first half of this century, according to the World Health Organization. Michael Smyer In the U.S. alone, adults 60 and older made up about 18% of the population in 2010, and by 2050 will reach about 25%. What does this have to do with climate change? This week, President Obama has a golden opportunity to add to his environmental legacy when the White House Conference on Aging convenes in Washington. At the moment, climate change is not on the conference agenda, which means the administration is missing an excellent chance to build up political consensus on this important issue for this fall's U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris. A year ago, Michael Bloomberg, Henry Paulson and Tom Steyer launched the Risky Business Project -- a bipartisan series of studies that laid out the very real economic and health risks facing the nation and each of its regions because of climate change. The Risky Business team applied the business discipline of risk assessment to the economic and health implications of the changing climate.
