The group is the same one that previously shot viral covert video of a Planned Parenthood leader discussing the sale of aborted fetuses for research. \nThe Los Angeles Superior Court order issued Tuesday prohibits the Center for Medical Progress from releasing any video of three StemExpress officials taken at a restaurant in May. \nStemExpress is a Placerville, California-based company that provides human tissue, blood and other specimens to researchers. Planned Parenthood is one of the company's providers of fetal tissue. \nThe Center for Medical Progress has released three covertly recorded videos. Anti-abortion groups have called on lawmakers to take action. \nCenter leader David Daleiden said StemExpress was using \"meritless litigation\" to cover up an \"illegal baby parts trade.\" Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T02:49:11.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
