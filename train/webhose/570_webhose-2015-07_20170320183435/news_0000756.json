Another man was seen holding the flag along Obama’s motorcade route as he returned to the airport.

The alleged shooter, Dylann Storm Roof, posted photos of himself online with Confederate flag memorabilia and claimed he wanted to start a race war. \nObama and political leaders in both parties have called the flag a symbol of hate and called for it to taken off government grounds across the South. \n\"For many, black and white, that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation,” Obama recently said at the eulogy for one of the victims of the shooting. “We see that now.” \n“Our flag doesn’t mean race, it’s a heritage thing,” one demonstrator, Rick Martin, told The Tennessean.
