Many Democrats are concerned that the accord could leave Israel vulnerable without doing enough to rein in Iran.\nObama warned lawmakers Tuesday that he would veto any measure that would prevent the agreement from going into effect. Overriding the veto in Congress would require a two-thirds majority, a tough challenge for Republican leaders.\nAll sides are squaring up for a protracted, bruising confrontation.\n\"The fight over the Iran deal is going to make the Obamacare battles look like two preppies slap-fighting over a cucumber sandwich,\" Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert, wrote in an article for Foreign Policy .\n'A path for Iran to engage constructively'\nUnder the agreement reached in Vienna, sanctions that have choked the Iranian economy will be rolled back in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities, which will be inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nJUST WATCHED John Kerry: 'This is the good deal we have sought' Replay More Videos ...

Panel of Experts on Iran, wrote in an opinion piece for CNN . \"It also provides a path for Iran to engage constructively with the world, more necessary now than ever before.\"\nThe agreement is also providing grist for candidates running for the U.S. presidency in 2016, with Republicans lining up to bash it and Democrats offering praise .\nCelebrations in Tehran\nThere was little sign of discord in Iran on Tuesday.\nJUST WATCHED Nuclear deal reached: What's next for Iran?

People cheered and danced. Congratulatory messages poured in on social media, praising President Hassan Rouhani for bringing an end to years of crushing sanctions.\n\"Negotiators have reached a good agreement, and I announce to our people that our prayers have come true,\" Rouhani said in a live address to the nation.\nHis government will now need to deflect any opposition to the deal from anti-American hardliners in the regime.\nRouhani's challenge is to navigate between \"a hardline minority, which has a monopoly on coercion, and the vast majority of Iranians, who want to see a country which puts its national interest before revolutionary ideology,\" said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nKey to that effort will be the support of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714181606-iran-nuclear-deal-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130823062608-capitol-hill-building-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714185623-iran-nuclear-deal-01-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130823062608-capitol-hill-building-story-body.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130823062608-capitol-hill-building-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714185623-iran-nuclear-deal-01-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714181606-iran-nuclear-deal-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714185623-iran-nuclear-deal-01-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714181606-iran-nuclear-deal-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714181606-iran-nuclear-deal-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714185623-iran-nuclear-deal-01-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714181606-iran-nuclear-deal-small-11.jpg", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/opinion/thomas-friedman-obama-makes-his-case-on-iran-nuclear-deal.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714181606-iran-nuclear-deal-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130823062608-capitol-hill-building-story-top.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714185623-iran-nuclear-deal-01-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714181606-iran-nuclear-deal-full-169.jpg", "https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/14/its-a-damn-good-deal-iran-nuclear-agreement-joint-comprehensive-plan-of-action/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130823062608-capitol-hill-building-hp-video.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714185623-iran-nuclear-deal-01-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714185623-iran-nuclear-deal-01-full-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T14:21:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
