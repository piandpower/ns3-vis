Destroying innocent life and harvesting human organs is beyond barbaric -- it is unimaginably immoral, grotesque, and evil. \nOnly evil could treat the organs of innocent babies as if they were fan belts, fenders, or fuel lines for a Ford -- to be swapped, sold, discarded and disposed at the whims of a mechanic. \nEach year, Planned Parenthood performs more than 300,000 abortions, and 92 percent of pregnant women who walk into Planned Parenthood receive an abortion. Since 1973, abortion has ended the lives of 60 million babies, and we will never know how many of these souls were harvested to the highest bidder. \nPlanned Parenthood isn’t a healthcare provider any more than Benghazi was a ’spontaneous protest’. \nIt should enrage every American that our government confiscates money from our paychecks only to bankroll these barbaric butchers with $500 million each year. This isn’t about women’s health, this is about making money off babies body parts. \nBut it’s not enough to say we’ll end funding for these butchers at Planned Parenthood. America needs to make a choice. \nSome spineless, soulless politicians “oppose” abortion but demand that it remain ‘legal and rare.” We didn’t end slavery by just making slave ownership “legal and rare.” We ended this sinful stain on our country by recognizing that it violated basic human rights and abolishing evil once-and-for-all. \nIn the face of human harvesting, it’s unacceptably unAmerican and immoral to bury our heads and hope this evil will disappear. It’s time for us to decide whether we accept, approve and endorse the willful destruction of human life. \nLife is Life. Americans believe the high school quarterback’s life matters just as much as the freshman with Down syndrome. While some plug their ears and cover their eyes, moral truths are moral truths. \nPeople can pretend that infants in the womb are blobs of animated protoplasm, but Truth is Truth. And science is making it much harder for Americans to ignore what their conscience already tells them. \nLife begins at conception, the science on that is actually settled. At the moment of conception, 23 male and 23 female chromosomes create a new DNA schedule. The DNA that is created at conception is the same DNA that will exist in each human for the rest of his or her life. \nAs we digest the disgusting footage of these cavalier conversations about harvesting human organs, we must remember that this battle is about more than just defunding Planned Parenthood. We must end the scourge, sin, and slaughter of abortion. And then we should ask God’s forgiveness for not doing it sooner. \nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is a 2016 Republican candidate for president of the United States.
