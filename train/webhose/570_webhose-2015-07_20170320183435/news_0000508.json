We honor their service. We offer our gratitude to the police officers and first responders who stopped the rampage and saved lives,\" Obama said in a proclamation. \"We draw strength from yet another American community that has come together with an unmistakable message to those who would try and do us harm: We do not give in to fear. You cannot divide us. And you will not change our way of life.\" \nObama directed that the flags be flown at half-staff until sunset on Saturday. \nRepublicans had called on Obama to lower the flag before he announced that he would do so on Tuesday. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ordered flags at the U.S. Capitol be flown at half-staff earlier that day . \nFive service members were killed after Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez opened fire at two military recruitment facilities.
