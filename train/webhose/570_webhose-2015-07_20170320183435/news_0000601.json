And you should know better.\" Paige Lavender Senior Politics Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 07/15/2015 \nPresident Barack Obama publicly scolded CBS News' Major Garrett during a gathering of the press corps at the White House on Wednesday, chastising the reporter for asking if the president is \"content\" to celebrate the Iran nuclear deal while four American hostages remain in Iran. \n\"That's nonsense. And you should know better,\" Obama replied. \nObama answered questions about the Iran nuclear deal during the gathering, saying it's \"our best means of assuring that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.\" Getty Images \n“The bottom line is this. This nuclear deal meets the national security interests of the United States and our allies,\" Obama said. \"It prevents the most serious threat of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon… that’s why this deal makes our country safer and secure.” \nSee Obama's exchange with Garrett above.
