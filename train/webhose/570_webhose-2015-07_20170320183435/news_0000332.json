The cringe-inducing videos have prompted calls from some Republicans to cut federal funding to the organization, but its critics have long wanted it out of the classroom.\n“If this doesn’t convince people of the truth – that Planned Parenthood is in the abortion business and doesn’t care about our daughters’ best interests – I don’t know what will.”\n- Karen England, Capitol Resource Institute\n“If this doesn’t convince people of the truth – that Planned Parenthood is in the abortion business and doesn’t care about our daughters’ best interests – I don’t know what will,” Karen England, executive director of California-based Capitol Resource Institute, told EAG news .\nPlanned Parenthood claims that taxpayer funds do not go to its abortion services, but its twin status as the nation's leading provider of both abortions and sex education instruction has long bothered groups such as the Eagle Forum.\n“Sex education in public schools should be handled with sensitivity and discretion instead of being handed off to a billion-dollar operation with a financial stake in these matters,” Glyn Wright, executive director of the Eagle Forum, told FoxNews.com. “Teaching abstinence, the safest choice for adolescents, will never fit their money-making agenda. From dirty clinics to harvested baby parts, Planned Parenthood refuses to observe basic standards of human decency, and at the very least, they should not have access to tax dollars to influence children. Congress should stop the funding streams to this barbaric organization.”\nRelated Image Expand / Contract A second video emerged on Tuesday that shows another Planned Parenthood official discussing prices for fetal tissue samples.\nValerie Huber, president and CEO of the National Abstinence Education Association, told EAG the shocking footage, the second clip of which was released Tuesday, could convince parents not to allow the group to teach their children about the birds and the bees.\n“We have long advocated that any group that normalizes or encourages teen sexual activity should not have access to students,” Huber said. “That applies to (Planned Parenthood) and other groups, so this new revelation does not change our stance. (But) it strengthened our antipathy to their fitness as role models for our youth. Regardless of one’s stance on abortion, this footage creates a visceral reaction to our sensibilities and humanity.”\nRelated Image Expand / Contract The Center for Medical Progress, which released the two undercover tapes, will likely release more in the the coming days.\nOfficials from Planned Parenthood have maintained that the video is a “gross mischaracterization” of their work and that their sex-ed programs are vital.\n“In 2013, Planned Parenthood provided education and outreach to 1.5 million people of all ages across the country,” Leslie Kantor, president of education for Planned Parenthood, told FoxNews.com in a statement. “In the U.S., teen pregnancy and birth rates have reached a historic low, and more young people are delaying sexual activity and using birth control when they do have sex.\n“Planned Parenthood wants all young people to have the information and resources they need to prevent unintended pregnancy, meet their life goals, and start their families when the time is right for them. We are proud to provide the sex education and services that help teens prevent unintended pregnancies, and we’re gratified that these efforts have contributed to this historic low in teen pregnancy rates.”\nPerry Chiaramonte is a reporter for FoxNews.com.
