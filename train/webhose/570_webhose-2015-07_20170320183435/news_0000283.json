The 78-year-old comedian, who has never been charged with a crime, denied some accusations while declining to comment or respond to the others. \nIn addition to Cosby's legal woes, a group supporting sexual assault victims is petitioning President Barack Obama to revoke Cosby's Presidential Medal of Freedom. More on this... Obama: No precedent for revoking Cosby's Medal of Freedom \nPromoting Awareness Victim Empowerment launched the campaign Wednesday through the White House's \"We the People\" website. The group says it is working with women who have accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting them. It's collected about 2,000 signatures in less than a day. \nPresident George W. Bush presented the nation's highest civilian honor to Cosby in 2002, citing his revolutionary portrayal of blacks on television and his interest and dedication to education. \nThe group's executive director says: \"Bill Cosby's name does not belong among this distinguished list.\" \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
