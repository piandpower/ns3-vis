Well, conventional [weapons] is the opposite of nuclear [weapons] that was not to be discussed at all…and we caved on that.”\n    3 Former   4   5  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T15:20:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
