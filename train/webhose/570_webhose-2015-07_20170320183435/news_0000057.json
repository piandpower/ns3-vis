The patch is the 34th short-term transportation measure since 2009. \nThe Senate passed the measure Thursday, one day before the deadline for a cutoff of funds. \nThe president says that while it's good news projects will continue to be funded, Congress needs to stop leaving business until the last minute. He says that's not how countries like China or Germany operate. \nThe Senate also passed a sweeping, long-term transportation bill that sets up discussions with the House this fall on the future of transportation policy and how to pay for programs.
