White House officials have been trumpeting the measure for the limits placed on uranium enrichment and broad access for international inspectors. RELATED: Iran nuclear deal highlights But Republicans have panned the measure as caving to Iran. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who holds bipartisan sway in Washington, has called it a \"historic mistake.\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, told CNN' \"New Day\" Wednesday morning, that after reading through the deal, he had determined: \"Unfortunately it's not as bad as I feared, it's actually much worse.\" Democratic frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton plied legislative Democrats on Tuesday during private meetings on the Hill. Obama warned Tuesday that he would veto any measure that throws the deal off-track -- effectively pushing the bar for Republicans and Democratic opponents to the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> Iran ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:44:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
