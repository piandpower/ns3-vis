The video contains extremely graphic footage of aborted fetuses from inside a Planned Parenthood clinic. The group, the Center for Medical Progress, obtained access to the clinic by posing as buyers for a fake medical company. The 11 1/2-minute video shows a Colorado medical director, Dr. Savita Ginde, speaking through a surgeon’s mask as she identifies fetal parts in a lab — such as heart, stomach and arms. At one point, the camera turns away from the petri dish as the doctor says, “Another boy!” The earlier part of the video shows Ginde, who is the vice president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, engaging in a casual conversation in an office about the “compensation” for parts. Ginde reiterates that the compensation is for “time and process” — which is legal under federal law — while the activists posing as buyers repeat that they are willing to pay “top dollar.” It is a similiar tactic used in previous videos, where the buyers offer extremely large amounts of money in apparent attempts to trap the clinic directors into accepting. Ginder takes a cautious approach to the buyer's offers, raising concerns of the public perception of their agreement and asking about the buyer's contacts of other clinics. “Even though we’re doing it for research, if it comes up that someone else is doing it as a business sort of venture, it puts a different spin on it,” she says. \n“Putting it under ‘research’ gives us a little bit of an overhang, sort of, over the whole thing,” Ginde said, adding that she wants to speak with other clinics and Planned Parenthood's national staff before proceeding. “If you have someone in a really anti state who’s going to be doing this for you, they’re probably going to get caught,” she says. Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards has forcefully denied that the clinic profits from some clinics' donation programs, which she has described as \"life-saving.\" The latest video, which comes just two days after the last , could signal that the group will be releasing the videos more frequently. Until now, the group had released one video per week. The group's organizer, David Daleiden, has said he has enough footage to create a total of 12 videos. The footage has fueled a firestorm in Congress and in statehouses nationwide. Multiple bills have been introduced in Congress to defund Planned Parenthood, including one from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) that wil receive a full Senate vote on Monday.
