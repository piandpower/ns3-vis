That is not the case,\" Obama quipped as the room broke out in laughter and applause. \nObama made his birth certificate public in 2011 after opponents questioned his birthplace and eligibility to be president, claiming he was not a U.S. citizen. The certificate lists Honolulu, Hawaii, as his place of birth. \nHis visit to Kenya marks the first time a sitting U.S. president has traveled to the East African nation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T19:37:46.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
