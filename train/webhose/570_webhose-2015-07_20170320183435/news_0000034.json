ADVERTISEMENT The proposed rule would ban the sale of ivory from African elephants, which have long been targeted by poachers for the U.S. and Asian markets. There will be some exemptions, as with previous U.S. rules on ivory. Antique items like musical instruments, furniture pieces and firearms that have small amounts of ivory can continue to be sold. \nThe U.S. remains the second-largest market for ivory, behind China, despite existing regulations. \nObama issued his last executive order to restrict ivory sales in 2013, coinciding with a previous trip to Africa. \n\"Given the unparalleled and escalating threats to African elephants, we believe a near-complete ban on commercial trade in elephant ivory is the best way to ensure U.S. domestic markets do not contribute to the decline of this species in the wild,\" the administration wrote in a statement then.
