ADVERTISEMENT Obama added it was a “shame” Congress allowed the bank’s charter to expire and said “it’s a no-brainer” to renew it. The White House is ramping up pressure on Congress to renew the Ex-Im bank before lawmakers leave for August recess. The bank, which provides loan guarantees to businesses shipping their goods to overseas markets, saw its charter lapse June 30 due to congressional inaction. Conservative members of the House and Senate oppose the bank, saying it's merely a form of corporate welfare. General Electric, Boeing and Caterpillar have received almost 90 percent of the bank’s loan guarantees. But the White House sought to undermine that argument by meeting with small-business owners who benefit from the bank. Obama is backed by a coalition of Democrats, business groups and some Republican allies in Congress. Obama dismissed the notion that the bank is a giveaway to big corporations, saying it “makes money for the U.S. government.” And he argued the bank’s lapse would put it the U.S. at a disadvantage because other countries have similar agencies that help their exporters. The White House on Wednesday said it is urging the senators to include a measure renewing the bank on on a must-pass highway bill. “As this legislation gets put together, we certainly would like to see and would insist upon the inclusion of the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank,” press secretary Josh Earnest said.
