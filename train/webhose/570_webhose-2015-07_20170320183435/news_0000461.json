Obama voiced strong support for gay rights in Africa. \nBut Kenyatta says while the U.S. and Kenya agree on a lot, there are some things that cultures or societies just don't accept. \nGay sex is a crime in Kenya punishable by up to 14 years in prison. \nKenyatta says it's very difficult to impose beliefs on people that they don't accept. He says his government wants to focus elsewhere. \nKenyatta says after Kenya deals with other, more pressing issues such as terrorism, it can begin to look at new issues. But he says for the moment, gay rights isn't at the forefront for Kenyans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T18:06:05.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
