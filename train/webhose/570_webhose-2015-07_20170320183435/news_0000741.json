The fringe movement began during the 2008 election season and persisted throughout Obama's first term in office, until he released his long-form birth certificate in 2011 that shows he was born in Hawaii. Since then, the President has often joked about the conspiracy theory. \"If I did not love America, I wouldn't have moved here from Kenya,\" the President quipped earlier this year . Donald Trump, a leading skeptic of Obama's claims that he was born in the United States, made headlines earlier this month when he told CNN's Anderson Cooper he still isn't totally convinced Obama was born in the United States. RELATED: Obama lectures Kenyan president on gay rights \"I don't know. I really don't know,\" he said. This is Obama's first trip to Kenya as President. He had previously visited the country on three other occasions. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> More from Politics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T03:45:54.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
