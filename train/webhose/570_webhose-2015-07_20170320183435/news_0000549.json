He has stirred up controversy in recent days for claiming \"rapists\" and \"killers\" are migrating over the United States' southern border. Univision and NBC Universal have cut ties with the businessman, refusing to air the \"Miss Universe\" pageant he partially owns as a result, and Macy's announced Wednesday it was also discontinuing his clothing line. On Wednesday, Trump, who is a Republican presidential candidate, told Lemon he was pulling his facts from a Fusion article . RELATED: Macy's dumps Donald Trump \"Well if you look at the statistics of people coming, you look at the statistics on rape, on crime, on everything coming in illegally into this country it's mind-boggling!\" he told Lemon, in a clip previewed on CNN's \"Situation Room.\" \"If you go to Fusion, you will see a story: About 80% of the women coming in, you know who owns Fusion? Univision! Go to Fusion and pick up the stories on rape. It's unbelievable when you look at what's going on. So all I'm doing is telling the truth,\" Trump said. Lemon replied that the press stories are about women being raped, but not about criminals coming across the border. \"Well, somebody's doing the raping, Don! I mean somebody's doing it! Who's doing the raping? Who's doing the raping?\" he asked. Trump currently sits at No. 2 in the latest CNN/ORC national poll. He told Lemon he is surprised only that he's trailing Jeb Bush, not that he's doing so well. \"I don't get it. He's in favor of Common Core, extremely weak on immigration. He thinks people come over for love. I don't understand why he's in first place,\" Trump said. \"Maybe it's the Bush name. Last thing we need is another Bush. But I will tell you, I'm a little surprised he's in the position he's in.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> Politics Originals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T01:59:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
