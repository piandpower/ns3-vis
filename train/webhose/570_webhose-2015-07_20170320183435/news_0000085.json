Earlier this month, details of a 2005 lawsuit were revealed that showed that Cosby admitted to getting prescription Quaaludes to give to women he wanted to have sex with. Shortly thereafter online petitions began to have Obama revoke the medal. The question came amid a press conference Obama gave to address questions about a deal to rein in Iran's nuclear program that will be under review from Congress soon. The question cam from April Ryan, Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:32:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
