Mike Huckabee and a handful of other Republicans that he said are part of an echo-sphere on the right that spurs \"outrageous\" attacks.\n\"We just don't fling out ad hominem attacks like that because it doesn't help inform the American people,\" Obama said Monday, while defending his administration's rollout of the Iran nuclear deal.\nThe President's comments -- made at a press conference in Ethiopia -- mark his most direct entrance to date into the Republicans' 2016 primary fight, which features at least 16 contenders, many of whom have hurled sharp verbal attacks at the White House, the Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and each other.\nObama, who's been deploying a freer, less restrained approach in the self proclaimed \"fourth quarter\" of his presidency, had largely focused his political attention this year on Congress and staid away from the 2016 fray -- until now.\nHe even named dropped Trump, who has continued leading most presidential polls -- including a CNN/ORC poll released Sunday -- despite comments deriding Sen.

Tom Cotton, in which the Arkansas Republican told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that Secretary of State John Kerry \"acted like Pontius Pilate\" by remitting oversight to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\"The point is we're creating a culture that is not conducive to good policy or good politics,\" Obama said Monday, during the close of his trip to Africa. \"The American people deserve better.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:56:21.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
