That is not the case.\" Posted: 07/26/2015 | Edited: 7 minutes ago \n(Reuters) U.S. president Barack Obama attended a state dinner in his honor in Nairobi, Kenya on Saturday (July 25). \nHe made jokes about his birth certificate in his father's homeland. \n\"I suspect that some of my critics back home are suggesting that I'm back here to look for my birth certificate. That is not the case,\" Obama quipped as the room broke out in laughter and applause. \nObama made his birth certificate public in 2011 after opponents questioned his birthplace and eligibility to be president, claiming he was not a U.S. citizen. The certificate lists Honolulu, Hawaii, as his place of birth. \nHis visit to Kenya marks the first time a sitting U.S. president has traveled to the East African nation.
