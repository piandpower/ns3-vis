(Reuters) \nA convicted Israeli spy will soon be released by the Obama administration in a move that some hope will improve relations with Israel following the Iran nuclear deal, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal . \nThe newspaper reported Friday that some U.S. officials are pushing for Jonathan Pollard’s release in a “matter of weeks,” but it may have to wait until his parole consideration date in November. \nPollard, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer, was convicted in 1987 for passing secret documents to Israel, and sentenced to life in prison. He is currently serving time in a federal prison in Butner, N.C. \nThe Journal reported that while some U.S. officials believe the move will improve relations with Israel, others denied any link between the release and the Iran deal. \nA White House spokesperson referred questions by The Journal to the Justice Department, which declined comment on the possibly release.
