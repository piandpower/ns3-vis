I could care less as long as they can't smoke it in the airport, you can't smoke it in the airplane. So depends if wherever they're going if it's legal, that's fine with me,\" Arnold Lucht told Fox 12.\n\"I'm not anti-marijuana, but I'm pro-hairspray. I would really like to have some hairspray or some shampoo. What's shampoo going to do to somebody? Why can't I take my shampoo on a plane? I think it's a little lopsided. Silly, it's actually silly,\" said Verena Douglas, who moved to Oregon from Colorado.\nThe news comes as recreational pot became legal in Oregon on July 1, a move celebrated on July 3 as hundreds of people gathered in downtown Portland for a “Weed the People” rally.\nThe State House has passed a bill allowing retail marijuana sales to begin on October 1.\nThe bill would allow tax-free retail sales through existing medical marijuana dispensaries.\nAdvertisement\nTrending in Travel 1 Spike Aerospace’s S-512 Supersonic Jet promises to fly from New York to London in three hours 2 New airplane seating design being called 'evil' 3 Last 2 HoJo restaurants soldier on 4 Video captures the magical moment a whale spouts a rainbow 5 Breathtaking photos of inside the old TWA Terminal See all Trends Hotel Finder Advertisement", "external_links": ["http://www.ibtimes.com/marijuana-legalization-oregon-portland-airport-allows-travelers-bring-weed-state-2003572", "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/v/fn2/misc/html/expedia/widget.html", "http://www.kptv.com/story/29506836/portland-international-airport-changes-recreational-pot-policy#ixzz3fVHH2LFg"], "published": "2015-07-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T18:31:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
