ADVERTISEMENT The announcement will come almost two weeks after Chicago was widely reported to be the site of the library. The foundation said it will reveal the location at 6 a.m. Tuesday morning and hold a press conference in the Windy City.\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) and Martin Nesbitt, a close friend of the Obamas and chairman of the Barack Obama Foundation, will make the announcement at the Gary Comer Youth Center on the city’s South Side. \nChicago, where the president and first lady lived and worked before Obama was elected to the Senate in 2004, has been long considered the front-runner to land the library. \nThe University of Chicago reportedly beat out three other finalists that submitted bids to build the library — the University of Illinois at Chicago, Columbia University in New York and the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. \n“Over the last 14 months, the foundation has evaluated more than a dozen potential sites … and considered a number of key factors, such as transportation and accessibility, economic development opportunities, community interest and engagement and the potential for academic and programmatic collaboration,” the foundation said in a statement.
