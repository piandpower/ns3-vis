But he said it is critical for “all the evidence” to be presented in the case. ADVERTISEMENT “What I think the people of Baltimore want more than anything else is the truth,” he said. “That's what people around the country expect.”\nObama added that Attorney General Loretta Lynch is in touch with Baltimore officials and offered to provide assistance in the investigation. The Department of Justice is also conducting its own probe into Gray's death. \nGray’s death sparked violent protests in Baltimore earlier this week. After criticizing those demonstrations, Obama said he was gratified to see the emergence of \"constructive, thoughtful\" peaceful protests. \nBaltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced Friday that the driver of a transport van carrying Gray, Officer Caesar Goodson, will face second-degree murder charges . \nThe other officers involved face a number of charges, including involuntary manslaughter, assault, and false imprisonment. \nMosby said Gray suffered a “severe and critical neck injury” while riding in the back of a Baltimore police van unsecured by a seat belt. \nBaltimore’s police union president wrote in a letter that “none of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-01T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-02T03:58:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
