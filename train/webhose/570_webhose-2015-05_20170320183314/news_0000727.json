Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama's popularity with the public is on the upswing, according to a new Gallup poll that found him enjoying his strongest approval rating in nearly two years. He's now seen favorably by 53% of Americans , a four-point increase since March and the best number he's seen since September 2013, when 58% of Americans viewed him favorably. That breaks down predictably along party lines, with 90% of Democrats viewing him favorably while only 13% of Republicans say the same. The overall boost in popularity seems to be driven in part by a steady improvement in his standing with independents â€” he's now seen favorably by 52% of independents, up 6 percentage points since April and 17 percentage points since last fall.
