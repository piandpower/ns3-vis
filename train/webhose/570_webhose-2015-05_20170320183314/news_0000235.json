Not one. When they talk about legal status, that is code for second-class status.\" Immigration has been a difficult issue for both parties in recent years, one that has befuddled the presidential administrations of both President Barack Obama and President George W. Bush, neither of whom could usher a comprehensive bill through Congress. The issue is fraught with political pitfalls, as leaders in both parties see the issue as a gateway toward securing votes from the rapidly growing Hispanic-American population. Christie, who said he plans to outline his own position on immigration in \"a detailed speech\" soon, suggested that Clinton's most recent position was unrealistic. \"Her position now is not really addressing what the country wants to hear about this,\" he said. \"That's not a thoughtful position.\" \"I haven't met a person yet whose undocumented who came here and said, 'The reason I came here was because I wanted to vote,'\" Christie said. \"They say they come here because they wanted to work. I think that's where the focus has to be.\" Potential 2016 presidential candidates 19 photos Sen.
