Jeb Bush predicts the Supreme Court ultimately will rule that President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration are unconstitutional. \nBush says he thinks Obama acted for \"political purposes\" and wanted to \"create a wedge for Democrats to win elections.\" \nFor now, federal courts have held up Obama's plan to shield as many as 5 million immigrants in the U.S. from deportation. \nBush also tells CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that he favors gradually raising the retirement age for Social Security. He says \"we need to look over the horizon\" and mentions going from age 65 to 68 or 70. Bush says that would help sustain the retirement system for anybody' under 40. \nBush isn't yet in the 2016 Republican presidential race, but says he'll have to make up his mind after a coming trip to Europe. \nLike us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-31T19:26:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
