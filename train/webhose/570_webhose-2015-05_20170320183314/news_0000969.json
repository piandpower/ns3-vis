Analysts say China faces the prospect of becoming the first country in the world to get old before it gets rich.\n Health 1 UK mom dies after cancer symptoms reportedly mistaken for pregnancy complications 2 Toddler needs finger amputation after grandma wraps bandage too tight 3 The Lyme disease debate: Can the condition be chronic? 4 YouTube star reveals she has two vaginas 5 Austrian magazine prints latest issue with HIV-positive blood See all Trends Spring Clean Your Diet More\nFathers have big influence on teens' drinking habits How eating microbes may aid in weight loss Trace amount of drilling fluid found in Pennsylvania water well, study says Overweight diabetes patients outlive slimmer ones, study says Sponsored content Integrative Cancer Care, With you at the center Cancer Therapy: Are you making the right choices?
