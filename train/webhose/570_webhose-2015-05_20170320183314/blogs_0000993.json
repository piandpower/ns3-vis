He signed the measure without ceremony Friday at the White House. \nNegotiators from the U.S., China, France, Russia, Great Britain and Germany are seeking a deal with Tehran by the end of June. Israel and some Persian Gulf nations worry Iran is simply delaying its nuclear ambitions to get economic sanctions lifted. \nThe legislation would bar Obama from waiving congressional sanctions for at least 30 days while lawmakers examine any final deal. Congress would have to pass a resolution of disapproval to reject the deal, an action Obama likely would veto. \nObama says he welcomes scrutiny of the negotiations.
