Just check out this stack.\nThis is just the arrests and plots involving ISIS in the last year -- Americans who have gone to the dark side -- but were stopped before they could wreak havoc. So lets get real. Seems to me we've been lucky to not experience an even bigger attack than what happened in Texas.\nNumber Two -- when asked if ISIS poses a real national security threat to the united states ... Americans overwhelmingly say yes at 81 percent.\nNumber three -- will President Obama finally \"get real\" about the terror threat? He's said he intends to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS -- but a new initiative may be necessary here at home.\nGretchen Carlson currently serves as anchor of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson (weekdays 2-3PM/ET) .
