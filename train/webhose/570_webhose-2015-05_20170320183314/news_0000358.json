ADVERTISEMENT The bill had initially been scheduled for a vote in January, but it had been abruptly cancelled after some Republicans voiced concerns about a requirement that rape victims have to report to the police before they have the procedure. Earnest said the White House’s previous veto threat still stands despite “some rather cursory changes” made to appease Republicans. “The bill continues to add a harsh burden to survivors of sexual assault, rape and incest who are already enduring unimaginable hardship,” he said. The legislation is expected to pass with broad support from Republicans, though it is unlikely to be taken up by the Senate. \nEarnest also blasted the bill as “entirely inconsistent” with the GOP’s repeated campaign to keep the government out of the doctor’s office. “This piece of legislation, ironically enough, would insert the government right between a woman and her doctor,” he said.
