Similar legislation received bipartisan support in other states, yet it was torpedoed by the GOP here.\nOnward Cadman went, finishing things off by taking advantage of a horrible Longmont murder to introduce fetal personhood legislation, modeled boiler-plate style, after a bill promoted by a national anti-choice group .\nSo, you've got Colorado Republicans focusing on immigration (against reform), birth control (against it), tax loopholes (in favor of retaining them), and personhood (for it). Exactly what the people don't want from the legislature!\nDemocrats had partisan legislation of their own, for sure, but for Tubbs to let Cadman say he \"focused on things that matter to both sides\" defies how Republicans actually used the power handed to them by voters in November, when control of the Colorado senate went to the GOP.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bigmedia-org/cadman-on-koa-morning-news-discussing-legislative-session\nFollow Jason Salzman on Twitter: www.twitter.com/BigMediaBlog\nMore: Bill Cadman Birth Control Steffan Tubbs Koa Republicans", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-colorado-licenses-20150122-story.html", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/203894756&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false", "https://soundcloud.com/bigmedia-org/cadman-on-koa-morning-news-discussing-legislative-session", "http://www.twitter.com/BigMediaBlog", "http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2015/04/29/colorado-gops-fetal-homicide-bill-based-legislation-promoted-anti-choice-group/", "http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2015/01/26/lawmaker-opposes-teen-pregnancy-prevention-program-iuds-stop-small-child-implanting/"], "published": "2015-05-05T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-05T21:40:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
