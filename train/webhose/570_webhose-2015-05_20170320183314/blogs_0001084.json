ADVERTISEMENT \"Politicians should not interfere with personal medical decisions, which should be left to a woman, her family and her faith, in consultation with her doctor or health care provider,\" Clinton's senior policy adviser Maya Harris said in a statement.\nShe added that the bill conflicts with Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court decision that protects the right to an abortion. Court precedent has generally protected abortions up to the point of viability, at 24 weeks. \n“This bill is a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, which has protected a woman's constitutional right to privacy for over forty years,\" Harris said. \"The bill puts women's health and rights at risk, undermines the role doctors play in health care decisions, burdens survivors of sexual assault, and is not based on sound science.\" \nThe campaign also linked the issue to state efforts to restrict abortions. \n\"It also follows a dangerous trend we are witnessing across the country. In just the first three months of 2015, more than 300 bills have been introduced in state legislatures — on top of the nearly 30 measures introduced in Congress — that restrict access to abortion,\" Harris said. \nClinton herself tweeted a similar message. When it comes to women's health, there are two kinds of experts: women and their doctors. True 40+ years ago, true today. -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 13, 2015 \nClinton has made women's rights a centerpiece of her campaign, and has also pushed issues such as paid family leave and equal pay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-14T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-16T11:12:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
