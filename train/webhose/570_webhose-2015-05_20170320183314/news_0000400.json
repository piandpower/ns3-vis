Twitter has a new @POTUS account. \nFor years, White House officials have used Twitter to communicate White House policy and occasional personal observations. \nBut Obama himself stayed out of the social media fray. \nNo longer. \nWith a frugal 91-character message -- 49 short of maximum permitted -- Obama on Monday declared: \"Hello, Twitter! It's Barack. Really! Six years in, they're finally giving me my own account.\" \nThe White House says the tweets on that account will come exclusively from the president. \nThe move is the latest by a White House particularly attuned to social media and new technology. But Twitter, with its ability to be anonymously interactive, is a new forum for the president, even one who carries his own Blackberry.
