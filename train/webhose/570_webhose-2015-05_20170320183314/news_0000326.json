ADVERTISEMENT The group included Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter (D), Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey and Fire Commissioner Derrick Sawyer.\nThe White House said Obama thanked them “for their swift work to treat the wounded and save lives” following last week’s derailment, which killed eight people and injured more than 200. \nThe brief meeting occurred on the tarmac of Philadelphia International Airport, where Obama landed to deliver a speech on police reforms in nearby Camden, N.J. \nThe president said last week he was “shocked and deeply saddened” by the derailment and called for increased spending on infrastructure. \n“We are a growing country with a growing economy. We need to invest in the infrastructure that keeps us that way,” Obama said during a press conference last Thursday. “That’s what great nations do.” Tags: Past: 1 day Report: Obama lied about bin Laden...
