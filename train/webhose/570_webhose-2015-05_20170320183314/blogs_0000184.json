This week, immigration groups and progressive organizations across the country are rallying in support of the President’s executive actions.\nAfter reading so many anti-Obama, anti-immigrant screeds, I began to wonder, what if all the Right’s most extreme rhetoric came together in one place? Behold! The ultimate anti-immigrant op-ed, brought to you by the Republican Party and their extremist base! Included are actual statements from GOP leaders and activists like Former Governor Jeb Bush, Representative Steve King (IA), and anti-immigrant leader William Gheen.\nPresident Obama’s Out to Destroy Our Nation Through His Executive Actions on Immigration\nPresident Obama’s lawless executive actions on immigration that protect DREAMers and families from deportation are an insult to the American people . Obama is acting like a Latin American dictator , King George , a tyrant , and Putin , abusing his power to promote his nefarious agenda .\nThis literally could be the death of the Republic . The executive actions could cause our country to descend abruptly into an abyss that we have never seen in the history of this country. Or at the least, the executive actions will turn us into a lawless third-world nation . Our Constitution will certainly be torn asunder .\nIf we stop families from being deported, we open the doors for our country to be invaded by immigrants , one person at a time. Our pockets are being picked and innocent people are being killed by illegal aliens and hurt and robbed and beaten and raped by criminal foreign nationals that are in our country. Most undocumented immigrants are 130-pound drug runners with calves the size of cantaloupes .\nThey're going to be dependent on welfare and handouts and hence will be dependent on the Democratic Party for their livelihoods. These immigrants just come here for easy acquisition of public support through welfare programs. They’re rushing over here because they’ve heard there’s a bowl of food just across the border. And once they’re here, they’ll raid the Social Security system and lie about their work history.\nThe impending new Latino majority in the U.S. (which will happen soon because of course immigrants are more fertile than native-born Americans) is dangerous – they could conduct an ethnic cleansing.\nWe can’t stand idly by as the President does this – he’s not above the law and above the Constitution . The Senate should not confirm a single nominee—executive or judicial—outside of vital national security positions, so long as the illegal amnesty persists. We could also shut down the government again!\nBut that’s not enough. We have a constitutional duty to stop this runaway, imperial presidency – should we impeach Obama ? And at some point, we have to evaluate whether the president's conduct aids or abets, encourages, or entices foreigners to unlawfully cross into the United States . That has a five-year in-jail penalty associated with it. We must also start talking about treason . Obama’s action certainly is an act of treason because it’s aiding and abetting the enemies of America and giving them comfort and aid.\nSo let’s arrest the president of the United States ! If not, there could be civil war .\nTo see even more anti-immigrant, anti-Obama rhetoric from the GOP – and who’s saying what – check out People For the American Way’s recent memos on this issue.\nMore: Daca Dapa Immigration Executive Action Elections 2016 Satire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-19T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-19T23:34:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
