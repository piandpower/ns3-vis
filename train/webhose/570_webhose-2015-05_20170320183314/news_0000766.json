Showers were in the forecast for Saturday. Torrential rains have already given the state its wettest month on record, according to Texas A&M climatologists . And extreme river and creek flooding has broken many records, and swept away hundreds of homes. Oklahoma has also broken its monthly rain record, according to reports. Six people have been confirmed dead in the aftermath of drenching rain there. Flooding also killed people in northern Mexico bringing the total death toll to at least 42. Some of the victims died in tornadoes. Late Friday, President Barack Obama declared \"a major disaster exists in the State of Texas.\" He ordered federal aid into the state. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has declared a state of disaster in 70 counties, which allows state resources to be used for storm response. Soaked ground The ground is soaked in much of both states, leaving little place for any additional runoff to retreat except into already stressed creeks and rivers. And flood warnings dotted the National Weather Service map early Saturday from the Texas Gulf Coast up through Missouri; most last through Saturday morning, but in some hotspots, such as Dallas, they extend into late Sunday. Fortunately, early Saturday's flooding was mostly minor, and weather relief appears on its way.
