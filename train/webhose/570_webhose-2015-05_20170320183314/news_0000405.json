The bulk of the Obamas’ wealth is invested in U.S. Treasury bills and notes, the total being estimated between $1.25 million and $5.25 million. ADVERTISEMENT The rest of the money is held in retirement savings accounts, checking accounts, a pension fund, and college savings accounts for their daughters, Malia and Sasha. Sales of two of the president's books, The Audacity of Hope and Dreams from My Father , allowed the Obama’s to take in $30,000 and $100,000 in royalties in 2014. The first family’s only disclosed liability is the mortgage on their Chicago home, listed between $500,000 and $1 million. The Obamas are required to submit the financial disclosure forms each year under federal law. They allow public officials to list the value of their assets and liabilities in broad ranges, making it difficult to calculate their exact net worth.
