Roger Wicker, and a Lee County judge. \nFederal agents eventually arrested another man, James Everett Dutschke of Tupelo, Mississippi. He pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 25 years in prison, and is doing time at the Supermax federal prison in Florence, Colorado. Dutschke has filed multiple motions to set aside his conviction.
