In particular, House Democrats may have the votes to sink the whole thing if Obama can't get them on board. \nClinton has been mum on the issue, and Boehner says it's time for her to start talking. \nWhen asked by NBC's Chuck Todd if he thinks Clinton needs to be more engaged, Boehner replied, \"I do.\" \n\"Hillary Clinton was for trade promotion authority. Hillary Clinton is for the trade bill with the Asians. She just won't say so,\" he said.
