Obama will argue in his address to graduates at the United States Coast Guard Academy that the fight against climate change is a fight for global peace and against the conflicts that lead to war, the White House said in a preview of his remarks. “I am here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security, and, make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country,” Obama will tell the new Coast Guard officers, according to the White House. “And so we need to act — and we need to act now.” ADVERTISEMENT A White House official said the speech will demonstrate how climate change “poses immediate risks to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters and resulting in humanitarian crises, and potentially increasing refugee flows and exacerbating conflicts over basic resources like food and water.” The White House is also releasing Wednesday an 11-page report on the national security implications of climate change, aggregating information from various federal reports on the subject. Obama has highlighted security implications of climate change in recent months to drum up more support for his efforts to invest in climate adaptation and reduce greenhouse gases, including a landmark regulation to limit carbon from power plants. In addition to the international problems that a changing climate can cause, Obama has argued the effects of climate change threaten military facilities and readiness. The White House said in February that climate change threatens more people than terrorism , a position that has proven extremely controversial. It led Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, to make a now-famous speech on the Senate floor in which he threw a snowball to draw attention to Obama’s comparison between terrorism and climate change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-20T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-20T13:52:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
