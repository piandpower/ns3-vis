Obama had not yet heard the nature of the charges as he spoke to reporters. RELATED: Who is Marilyn Mosby? House Speaker John Boehner called the officers' actions \"outrageous\" and \"unacceptable\" if the charges are proven true. \"Public servants should not violate the law,\" he said Friday in an interview set to air Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" Boehner also said he believes the relationship between African-Americans and law enforcement is a national crisis. \"I think that if you look at what's happened over the course of the last year, you just have to scratch your head,\" Boehner said. The Congressional Black Caucus applauded Mosby's \"swift and decisive action,\" but cautioned that the charges are just the beginning of a long process.
