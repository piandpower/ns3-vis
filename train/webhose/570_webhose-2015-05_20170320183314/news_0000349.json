One. What the hell happened to the rest of them?\" Boehner said on the House floor, referring to officials involved in the ongoing scandal over chronic delays at the agency. \"If only the VA did as good a job taking care of bureaucrats as our veterans, we'd be in better shape.\" \nA year after the scandal first broke, statistics compiled by the Veterans Administration have not shown a decline in the number of patients facing long waits for care. \nThe speaker also criticized the agency for spending $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules, as revealed by a new report last week. \n\"This isn't run-of-the-mill incompetence. It's arrogance,\" Boehner said. \"Only the administration can change the culture from within. The president owes the American people a long-term plan to fix the VA.\" Also on HuffPost: John Boehner's Lips Are Sealed of   U.S. Speaker of the House Rep.
