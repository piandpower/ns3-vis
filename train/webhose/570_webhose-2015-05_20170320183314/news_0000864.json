Obama and the administration have been pressing Congress to resolve a dispute over the surveillance provisions, saying the programs are essential to protecting Americans' national security. Unless lawmakers can come to an agreement by midnight Sunday, the National Security Agency must wind down its bulk phone data collection program, a measure that allows for surveillance of \"lone wolf\" terrorists and the ability to track burner phones.
