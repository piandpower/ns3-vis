Wright Updated 0739 GMT (1439 HKT) May 20, 2015 Washington, D.C. (CNN) It looks like Mitt Romney isn't the only one lacing up his boxing gloves . First lady Michelle Obama welcomed President Obama to Twitter Tuesday night with some impressive moves in a slick new workout video, \"FLOTUS-style.\" As part of her Let's Move! program's #Gimmefive challenge, the First Lady showed off five ways to exercise and stay healthy. — The First Lady (@FLOTUS) May 20, 2015 While many have taken the opportunity to greet President Obama's arrival on Twitter: Welcome to @Twitter , @POTUS ! One question: Does that username stay with the office? #askingforafriend — Bill Clinton (@billclinton) May 18, 2015 Good question, @billclinton . The handle comes with the house. Know anyone interested in @FLOTUS ? — President Obama (@POTUS) May 18, 2015 Few have been quite so inspirational. Commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Let's Move! program, the #Gimmefive challenge is an effort to \"encourage Americans across the country to give out high-fives when they see someone making healthy choices,\" and to list five things they are doing \"to eat better, be more active, and lead a healthier life,\" according to the Let's Move! website . First lady Michelle Obama started the Let's Move! initiative five years ago as a way to combat childhood obesity and promote healthy habits. Between jumping rope, lifting weights, and boxing, maybe now we know how Obama got those famously sculpted arms .
