Americans appear to be suspicious of Clintonâs honesty, and even many Democrats are only lukewarm about her presidential candidacy, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) \nLAS VEGAS (AP) – Hillary Rodham Clinton will focus on immigration when she makes a campaign stop Tuesday in Las Vegas. \nThe former first lady and secretary of state will take part in a round-table discussion with Nevadans beginning at 2:45 p.m. Tuesday at Rancho High School. \nHer campaign team, in a statement, says it will be the first of many conversations the expected Democratic presidential nominee will have with Nevadans concerning the “four fights” that define her campaign. \nPlans call for the Las Vegas stop to emphasize her fight to strengthen families and communities, and specifically how to change the immigration system so families can stay together. \nOver 25 percent of Nevada’s population is Hispanic. \nHer event will be similar to the recent small-scale sessions with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. \nNevada’s caucuses are held early in the presidential nominating calendar, and like Iowa and New Hampshire, it is expected to be a hotly-contested battleground state in the general election. \nLike us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-05T13:39:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
