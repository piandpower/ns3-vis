Washington (CNN) In his commencement speech to the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, President Barack Obama will focus on a topic he calls an immediate national security threat: climate change. \"Climate change will impact every country on the planet. No nation is immune,\" Obama will say, according to excerpts from his prepared remarks. \"So I am here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security, and, make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country. And so we need to act — and we need to act now.\" During Wednesday's commencement, Obama will stress the effects of climate change and its role in natural disasters and humanitarian crises, citing potential increases in refugee flows, a lack of food and water and threatening the readiness of U.S. military forces. \"Many of our military installations are on the coast, including, of course, our Coast Guard stations. Around Norfolk, high tides and storms increasingly flood parts of our Navy base and an air base. In Alaska, thawing permafrost is damaging military facilities. Out West, deeper droughts and longer wildfires could threaten training areas our troops depend on.\" Earlier this month, the Obama administration, citing \"rigorous safety standards\" and a long review process, granted conditional approval to energy giant Shell to begin oil drilling in the Arctic waters off the coast of Alaska. The move has upset environmental activists who are concerned the drilling will have detrimental effects. RELATED: Obama turns up heat on climate change debate in Florida The Interior Department wrote in a statement that Shell could begin drilling in the Chukchi Sea once several environmental conditions are met, including a sign-off from agencies assessing the impact on endangered species. State agencies must also approve the plan. The Department of Defense is looking into climate change's effects on the military's more than 7,000 bases and the need for the National Guard as extreme weather events continue. \"You are part of the first generation of officers to begin your service in a world where the effects of climate change are so clearly upon us. Climate change will shape how every one of our services plan, operate, train, equip, and protect their infrastructure, today and for the long-term,\" President Obama will tell over 200 cadets. This is not the first time Obama has stressed the effects of climate change, in the past the White House has stressed its impact on health and declining property values. The Obama administration has ramped up actions meant to curb the effects of climate change, including putting new regulations on coal plants and implementing new limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The executive actions -- taken after legislative moves appeared all but impossible -- could form a major part of Obama's environmental legacy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-20T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-20T17:39:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
