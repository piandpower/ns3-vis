Claudio Gimenez said in Sunday's homily that, in his words, \"Some want to legalize abortion, the killing of an innocent who still is in a period of gestation.\"\nOn the other side is former Health Minister Esperanza Martinez. She says officials' focus on whether the girl is physically able to bear a child overlooks her own mental and physical wellbeing. In Martinez's words: \"This girl became a uterus. She became a birth canal.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.ap.org/"], "published": "2015-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-10T23:14:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
