Many workers say they love the program, and employers say it hasn't hurt business as some feared it would. \nAbout 5,000 people have taken paid family leave in Rhode Island so far. \nOne of the beneficiaries, Anne Quirk, says it was a stress reliever, knowing there was going to be money to help pay the bills.
