The Barack Obama Foundation's largest contribution of $1 million came from Fred Eychaner, a major Democratic donor and founder of Chicago-based Newsweb Corp. \nThe foundation also received a $1 million pledge from the Joyce Foundation, a Chicago-based nonprofit on whose board Obama served before he ran for the U.S. Senate. The Joyce Foundation is making its money available in thirds between 2014 and 2016. \nThe library foundation announced last week that it would establish the library on the South Side of Chicago on a site proposed by the University of Chicago, after also entertaining bids made by Columbia University in New York where Obama attended college, the University of Hawaii and the University of Illinois at Chicago. \nThe foundation, which posted its tax returns on its website Monday, reported nearly $2 million in expenses, with more than half a million dollars in fundraising costs. Foundation officials have said most of the funds to build the library won't be raised until after the Obamas leave the White House. Obama and the first lady have pledged not to raise money for the foundation until the end of his presidency in January 2017. \nOther donors: \nCari and Michael Sacks. Michael Sacks is a Chicago business executive with close ties to Obama's former chief of staff, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel -- $666,666. \nIan Simmons, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based investor and philanthropist married to Liesel Anne Pritzker of Chicago's Pritzker family -- $500,000 \nTom and Sonya Campion, Seattle-based philanthropists who have been Obama political donors. Tom Campion is co-founder of the apparel chain Zumiez -- $500,000. \nTim Gill and Scott Miller, Denver-based philanthropists who advocate for gay rights -- $432,876. \nJames and Marilyn Simons. James Simons is a New York-based hedge fund manager -- $340,000. \nMark Gallogly, an investor who sits on the board of Columbia University's business school, and his wife, Lise Strickler -- $340,000. \nTim Collins, a New York-based private equity investor -- $300,000. \nDavid Shaw, a New York hedge fund manager, and his wife, Beth Kobliner, a personal finance journalist -- $250,000. \nRobert and Carol Wolf.
