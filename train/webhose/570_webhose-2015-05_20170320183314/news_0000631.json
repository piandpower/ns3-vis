Over the next 10 years, the company said the trade deal could also indirectly lead to as many as 40,000 jobs along the supply chain. \nRelated: Donald Trump slams Pacific free trade deal \n\"Our employees and our business depend on free trade and the ability to reach athletes and consumers around the world,\" said Nike CEO Mark Parker. \nNike said the deal would encourage free trade and help it innovate. The deal would also eliminate certain international tariffs Nike has to pay. \nThe U.S. government estimates an agreement would add $223 billion per year to the global economy by 2025. \n-- CNNMoney's Alanna Petroff contributed to this report CNNMoney (New York) May 8, 2015: 10:26 AM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-08T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-08T18:10:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
