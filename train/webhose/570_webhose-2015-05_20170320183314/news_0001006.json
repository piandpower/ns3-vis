The meeting was originally scheduled between Obama and Saudi King Salman, who over the weekend withdrew his RSVP for this week's summit of Gulf leaders. Some experts declared the change in plans a snub to the White House, meant to convey Saudi displeasure at various administration policies, including nuclear talks with Iran. But both U.S. administration officials and Saudi government aides said there was no snub intended, and in his office Wednesday Obama declared the bonds between the countries strong. Saudi Arabia \"has been absolutely critical not only to maintaining stability in the region but also protecting the American people,\" he said. He said he planned to discuss with the Saudi officials the ongoing unrest in Yemen, where a brief ceasefire appears to be holding after violence erupted between Shi'ite rebels and pro-government forces. Saudi Arabia led an air campaign to beat back the Houthi rebels, which are believed to be controlled partly by Iran, Saudi's regional rival.
