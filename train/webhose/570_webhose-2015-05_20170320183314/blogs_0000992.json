I didn’t say like that to him. Like I said, ‘Mr. President,’ and everything, ‘hello.’” \n“I don’t think he wanted me to talk very profound things,” Vergara said, imagining how a more serious convo with Obama might go: “Sit down right now about the situation with trade in Colombia, Mr. President. Let’s sit down for a second.” \n“You have to like, respect his time,” Vergara exclaimed. “He’s the president of the United States. He has more important things to do than talk with me, chit chatting.” Tags: Past: 1 day McConnell’s tough choice on Iran McConnell could file to end debate on the Iran bill, or he could allow a...
