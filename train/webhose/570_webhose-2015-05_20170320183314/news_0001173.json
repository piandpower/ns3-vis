He didn’t go to Ferguson. Didn’t go to Sanford. Didn’t go to North Charleston,\" Todd said, referring to the cities where Michael Brown , Trayvon Martin and Walter Scott were killed, respectively. \"And they've said they’re not going to Baltimore.\" \n\"That image though,\" he continued, \"Wouldn't that be a powerful image if he's walking the streets of inner-city Baltimore?\" \nApril Ryan, the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, agreed with Todd, pointing out that this moment in time is going to be part of Obama's legacy. \n\"I do believe President Obama should go, and it sends a powerful message,\" she said. \"Because there are going to be more of these situations and I think people really need to know that the leader of this country is there.\" More: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-04T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-04T23:58:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
