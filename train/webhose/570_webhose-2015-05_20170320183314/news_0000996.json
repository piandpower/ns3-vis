They would hand off the luggage to passengers waiting to board planes, who would transport them as carry-on to cities nationwide. \nAccording to the complaint, the group was operating as early as July 2012. \nThe baggage handlers were identified as Kenneth Wayne Fleming of San Leandro, Keith Ramon Mayfield and Michael Herb Videau of Oakland. \nHaag says the three men have been charged with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana.
