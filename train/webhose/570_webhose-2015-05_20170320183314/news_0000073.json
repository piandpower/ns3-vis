During the annual White House Easter Egg Roll this year, a swarm of bees interrupted the president while he was reading Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are to a group of children. \nDuring the library visit Thursday, Obama answered several questions about his reading habits. \n\"I'm still a big Dr. Seuss fan,\" Obama said. \"I was into adventure stories. There was something called 'The Hardy Boys' back in the day.\" \nOne student in the audience asked him about the kind of technology he had in school while he was growing up. Obama said he wasn’t a fan of using typewriters. \n\"You had to get this thing called White-Out,\" he said. \"You guys don't even know how good you've got it.\" \nDuring the event, Obama announced that major book publishers will provide more than $250 million of free e-books to be given to low-income students. \nWatch the president get interrupted above.
