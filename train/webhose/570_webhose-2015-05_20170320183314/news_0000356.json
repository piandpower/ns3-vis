Washington (CNN) Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh is alleging President Barack Obama and his administration lied about the circumstances surrounding the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden. Citing an anonymous \"major U.S. source,\" Hersh writes in the London Review of Books that the Obama administration cooperated with Pakistani intelligence officials to kill the al Qaeda leader, and that the chief of staff of the Pakistani army and director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence Agency knew about the mission, contrary to Obama's claim that Pakistani officials weren't aware of the raid in advance. The administration has said they received information on bin Laden's whereabouts by tracking his courier, and that the top military target was killed in a firefight with an elite team of Navy SEALs. RELATED: Trail leading to bin Laden began with his trusted courier But Hersh writes that the Obama administration had initially agreed to say bin Laden had been killed by a drone strike; that ISI was holding bin Laden a prisoner at the Abbottabad compound where he was killed, and that a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer told the U.S. of his whereabouts for the $25 million award being offered at the time. His source is identified as a \"retired senior intelligence official who was knowledgeable about the initial intelligence about bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad.\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-11T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-11T15:19:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
