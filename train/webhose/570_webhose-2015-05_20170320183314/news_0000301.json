Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton is accusing congressional Republicans of \"overruling the Democratic process\" in Washington with a Thursday night vote to block a D.C. law banning discrimination by employers against employees who have had abortions. In a statement provided exclusively to CNN, Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri lauded Clinton's record on women's issues, and promised that the former secretary of state would \"fight to make it easier ... for women and families to get ahead.\" RELATED: House Republicans secure vote in bid to block D.C. abortion law \"Hillary Clinton has fought for women and families and their right to access the full range of reproductive health care without interference from politicians or employers,\" Palmieri said. \"Hillary will fight to make it easier, not more difficult, for women and families to get ahead and ensure that women are not discriminated against for personal medical decisions.\" The bill in question would roll back a D.C. law approved in December that bars city employers from taking punitive action against employees for using abortion services or birth control. Under the Constitution, Congress can nullify laws passed by the Washington city council, but it's required to weigh in within 30 days after the measure has been sent to Capitol Hill. RELATED: Hillary Clinton's gender tightrope That deadline comes Friday, and both the House and the Senate must pass a resolution of disapproval to prevent the law from going into effect this weekend. While it's expected to easily pass in the House during a late Thursday-night vote, there's no indication the Senate will take it up, and the White House issued a veto threat against the GOP measure on Thursday. But Team Clinton's move to weigh in on the measure is a clear signal that the former secretary of state won't shy away from the perennial controversy surrounding abortion rights as she makes her second presidential bid. While Republicans continue to push restrictions on abortion rights, Democrats see the issue as a political winner as they believe it appeals to a key portion of their base -- single female voters. And this time around, Clinton has embraced her gender, focusing heavily on women's rights and the prospect of becoming the nation's first female president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-01T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-01T03:58:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
