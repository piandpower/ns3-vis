Bush and Barack Obama absorb information. \nMichael Morell, a former deputy director of the CIA who was with the agency for 33 years, delivered the president's daily brief to both Bush and Obama. \nDuring an interview, Fox News' Elisabeth Hasselbeck asked Morell what the differences were between briefing former President Bush versus briefing President Obama. Morell said some things were very similar, explaining that both presidents \"craved intelligence.\" \nThe difference between the two men, he said, was how they took in the information they received. \n\"President Bush best absorbed it by having a conversation like we're having,\" Morell said. \"President Obama absorbs it best by reading it.\" \n\"But do you know that he reads it every day?\" co-host Brian Kilmeade pressed. \n\"Yes,\" Morell said sternly. \"Yes.\" \nNice try, Kilmeade.
