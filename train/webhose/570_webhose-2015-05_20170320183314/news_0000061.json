Here's how it begins: \nHi, everybody. This weekend is Memorial Day-a time to pay tribute to all our men and women in uniform who've ever given their lives so that we can live in freedom and security. This year, the holiday is especially meaningful. It's the first Memorial Day since our war ended in Afghanistan. \nThere are a couple of things in that first paragraph I found off-putting. (I'll acknowledge I tend to find many things President Obama says off-putting). \nFirst of all, \"Hi, everybody?\" Really? For a Memorial Day tribute? \nMore important, think about the President's claim that \"This year, the holiday is especially meaningful.\" He's wrong. Memorial Day is equally meaningful whether we're conducting combat operations in Afghanistan or not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-25T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-26T01:58:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
