Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie were the first to criticize Obama after Secretary of State John Kerry formally removed Cuba from the list, where it has been since 1982. \n“Neither continued repression at home nor Cuba’s destabilizing activities abroad appear sufficient to stop President Obama from making further concessions to the Communist regime in Havana,\" Bush said in a statement released by his Right to Rise PAC. ADVERTISEMENT \"Today’s news is further evidence that President Obama seems more interested in capitulating to our adversaries than in confronting them,\" he said, adding, \"Iran’s leaders are surely taking note.\"\nCuba's removal from the list leaves three countries on it — Sudan, Syria and Iran — with the Obama administration hoping to finalize an international accord with Tehran over its nuclear program next month. \nChristie, who has been similarly critical of the Obama administration's moves to normalize relations with Cuba, pointed to the island nation harboring a woman convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper. \n“While President Obama gave away normalization months ago, we must force formal requests for extradition of wanted criminals and human rights demands each step of the way before additional diplomatic rights are granted,\" Christie said in a statement released by his office. \n\"President Obama’s failure to require justice in giving away the terrorist sponsorship designation is an unacceptable offense to the family of the fallen New Jersey State Trooper and every other wanted criminal that still lives freely in Cuba today,\" he added. \nSen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), a 2016 hopeful who is one of the most vocal critics of normalizing Cuba relations, also blasted the move. \n\"I simply don’t understand how the president can, in good conscience, continue these giveaways to the Castro regime,\" Rubio, a Cuban-American, said in taped remarks. \nRubio also questioned sending an ambassador to Cuba citing \"many unanswered questions and security gaps\" about their safety. \nRubio has formally declared a bid, while Christie and Bush are expected to join the crowded GOP field soon. The field saw two more entrants, former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) and former New York Gov. George Pataki, just this week. \nChristie's political stock has fallen in recent months while Bush and Rubio have remained near the top of the pack in recent polling. \nBoth Christie and Bush are considered to be more experienced on domestic policy issues. \nThe criticisms from the GOP hopefuls came just hours after the State Department removed Cuba from the terrorism watch list. \nMeanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic White House candidate in 2016, praised the decision. \n\"This is a major step forward in rebuilding our relationship with Cuba,\" he said in a statement, adding Obama was right to move \"aggressively\" to normalize relations. \nCuba was removed from the list after a 45-day review period for Congress came to an end Friday. Obama had called for the change last month, and the White House said Friday it was \"pleased\" with the development. \nThis story was updated at 5:29 p.m. Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-30T05:02:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
