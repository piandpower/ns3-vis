ADVERTISEMENT Movie star Robert Downey Jr. previously held the record after his account reached 1 million followers in 23 hours and 22 minutes in April 2014.\nObama burst onto the Twitter scene with a tweet from his new account just before noon on Monday. \nThe White House said in a blog post that the account will allow the president to “engage directly with the American people, with tweets coming exclusively from him.” \nThat’s a departure from his previous account, @BarackObama, which is mostly run by Organizing for Action, the group that formed out of Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. \nObama now can add another Guinness World Record victory to his list, which includes a number of social media prizes. His @BarackObama account already had the most followers for any politician, and he had the most expensive and most heavily guarded presidential inauguration in 2009. \nHis tweet immediately after his reelection in 2012 broke three Guinness records: most widespread social network message in 24 hours, most likes on a Facebook item in 24 hours and most likes on a Facebook item.
