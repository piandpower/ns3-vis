We're heartbroken by him leaving us far too soon - but we celebrate a remarkable legacy.\" \nThe message was signed \"-bo\" - the president's initials. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg replied , \"Thank you for this beautiful tribute.\" \nGoldberg died Friday after collapsing while on vacation in Mexico , according to the prosecutor's office in Nayarit State.
