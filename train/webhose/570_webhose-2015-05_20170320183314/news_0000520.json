John McCain called President Barack Obama's declaration that the U.S. isn't losing the fight against ISIS \"mind-boggling\" in an interview on CNN on Friday. In reality, McCain said on CNN's \"New Day,\" \"the President's strategy is certainly not succeeding â€” it's an abject failure,\" one that will eventually bring Americans around to the prospect of deploying boots on the ground in Iraq. \"It's mind-boggling that the President could keep saying, and (administration officials) could keep saying what they're saying while thousands of people are being butchered, burning bodies in the streets, executions, beheadings,\" he said. \"This is a disaster. It was predicted by me and Sen. Lindsey Graham, and it's going to go on until we develop a strategy.\" Such a strategy, in McCain and Graham's mind, would require the deployment of 10,000 U.S. troops to help Iraqis fight back the terrorist group, which has made significant advances over the past week. Last weekend, ISIS forces took over the key Iraqi city of Ramadi, a development that the Pentagon labeled a \"failure.\" But in an interview with the Atlantic published Thursday, Obama said there were challenges in Iraq but expressed confidence in his overall strategy to combat ISIS. \"No, I don't think we're losing,\" he said, but acknowledged: \"There's no doubt there was a tactical setback\" in Ramadi.
