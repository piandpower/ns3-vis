Approved trade and private sector business activities would also be allowed. \nUnder the U.S. trade embargo, Americans are not allowed to visit Cuba on regular tourist vacations. \nBaja Ferries plans to offer services three to four days a week, using ships carrying about 1,000 passengers and cargo, on an overnight service with sleeping cabins and dining facilities. \nAmerica Cruise Ferries also plans to operate three times a week between Miami and Havana with about 1,000 passengers as well as vehicles and freight, said James Whisenand, a Miami lawyer who handled the company's application. \n\"They would like to start operating immediately, but that is subject to final negotiations with the Cuban government,\" he said. \nThree other companies received licenses according to the Sun Sentinel newspaper, including Havana Ferry Partners of Fort Lauderdale, which plans to operate a service from Key West to Havana.
