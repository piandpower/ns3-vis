The Prophet is our leader. The Koran is our law. Jihad is our way. Dying in the way of Allah is our highest hope.\" \nThat is the organization that we are empowering – that we are arming – at American taxpayer expense. \nIn the coming days and weeks, secular and Christian opposition leaders are planning nationwide protests against a Morsi regime that has proven competent at implementing Shariah law but not at running an economy. \nMorsi’s jihadist allies plan a crackdown, and if and when they succeed, you may see the terrible sight of American-made and taxpayer-purchased tanks and other armored vehicles literally crushing the Christian opposition. \nThe saying goes that there is “no better friend and no worse enemy” than a United States Marine. \nThe Obama administration has turned this on its head. -- When it comes to the Middle East, we have proven to be the worst of friends and the best of enemies. \nWe sat on our hands during Iran’s Green Revolution, when the Mullahs were briefly in danger of being overthrown. \nWe similarly sat on our hands in the early days of the Syrian uprising against the brutal, Iran-allied Assad regime, before jihadists had taken over the Syrian opposition. \nBut we acted quickly to support the Egyptian uprising, tossing aside a longtime ally. \nAcross the Middle East, jihad is ascendant. The Mullahs remain comfortably in power in Iran (busy building a bomb), Syria’s opposition is dominated by Al Qaeda-affiliated militias, and Egypt is firmly in the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood. \nAnd now we’re arming Egypt and considering arming jihadist rebels in Syria. \nThe Obama administration is doubling down on failure – at the expense of Egyptian Christians and the American taxpayer. \nJay Sekulow is Chief Counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), which focuses on constitutional law.
