ADVERTISEMENT “Let us hope that Archbishop Romero’s vision can inspire all of us to respect the dignity of all human beings, and to work for justice and peace in our hemisphere and beyond,” he added.\nRomero served as the fourth archbishop of San Salvador, El Salvador’s capital city. \nHe was assassinated at its Church of the Divine Providence on March 24, 1980, while performing Mass. \nThe incident prompted the Catholic Church’s recognition of Romero as a martyr for his peaceful criticism of injustices committed by El Salvador’s oppressive regime at the time. \nBeatification is one of the Catholic Church’s highest honors. It is a blessing that recognizes an individual’s entrance into heaven and ability to act on the prayers of believers. \nObama said that Romero deserved that distinction following his tireless work for the El Salvadoran people. \n“Archbishop Romero was an inspiration for people in El Salvador and across the Americas,” Obama said. “He was a wise man and a courageous pastor who persevered in the face of opposition from extremes on both sides.\" \n“He fearlessly confronted the evils he saw, guided by the needs of his beloved pueblo, the poor and oppressed people of El Salvador,” he added. \nPope Francis is also a native of South America, having served as the archbishop of Buenos Aires before his papal confirmation in March 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-23T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-23T20:08:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
