He did not respond to a request for comment. Paul Begala, another Democratic strategist, who advised Israeli Labor leader Isaac Herzog, pointed to the condensed time frame for elections there as partly to blame. \"The short duration of campaigns in countries like Israel and the UK limits how much data you can compile, as well as the number of times you can contact voters,\" he said. Elections run about three months in Israel and six weeks in the UK. Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and longtime Labour Party adviser, agreed. \"The data techniques are greatly overrated in their effectiveness outside of the U.S.,\" he said. But in the UK election, the issue for the Labour Party wasn't a failure of data or technology, Greenberg argued -- it was the politics of division used by Conservatives. \"The Conservatives did well in running as an anti-immigration, anti-Europe and anti-Scots party,\" he said. That strategy, Greenberg contended, might provide Republicans in the United States with a blueprint for a similar showing in 2016. \"The Republican Party is an anti-immigration party,\" he said. \"They may look at how, in the end, the Conservatives were able to grow their vote by polarizing around the anti-Scottish sentiment in the UK.\" UK election shock: David Cameron defies polls Faulted for playing both sides of the fence Greenberg defended Axelrod's performance, arguing that his role -- \"mostly to refine the message, to focus on that core issue of what's facing working people\" was actually \"pretty effective.\" He pointed out that Miliband's popularity improved by the end of the election.
