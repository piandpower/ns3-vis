During the speech, Obama made a comment that there are too many black and Latino men in the United States who have been treated unfairly by officials. \nHasselbeck called his words \"a verbal assault on law enforcement.\" \n\"On the very day that you saw Brian Moore leaving the hospital dead after being shot while on duty, the president takes the opportunity to say something like that,\" she continued. \nHenry added that while there are some \"bad apples\" among officers, the president cannot attack everyone involved in law enforcement.
