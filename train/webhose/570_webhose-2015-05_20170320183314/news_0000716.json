(AP) â€” Michelle Obama is visiting Alabama to give the commencement address at Tuskegee University. \nThe first lady will speak Saturday morning to about 500 graduates at the historically black university. \nObama will become the second first lady to visit the private school. Eleanor Roosevelt was the first in 1941, when she flew with a black Army pilot to show support for the famed Tuskegee Airmen. \nThe Tuskegee commencement is one of three graduation ceremonies Obama will speak at this year. She will also deliver remarks at Oberlin College and a high school in her hometown of Chicago. \nThe first lady last visited Alabama in March. She accompanied President Barack Obama and their two daughters to Selma for the 50th anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march.
