The two talked about the unrest in Baltimore, 2016 elections and of course, how they plan to spend their retirement. \"I was thinking we could play dominoes together,\" the President quipped when asked about his future plans. \"We can go to the local Starbucks and swap stories.\" Obama's post presidential plans came into focus earlier in the day, when he helped re-launch the My Brother's Keeper Alliance, a nonprofit offshoot of his initiative by the same name, which aims to give young men of color more opportunities and access to education. The President's appearance on the \"Late Show\" comes on the heels of a slew of celebrity goodbye visits to the show, including the First Lady last week. \"I know you like Michelle a little bit more than me,\" the President told Letterman. \"And I assure you, you are not alone.\" Letterman's final episode of the \"Late Show\" airs May 20. Obama praised the late night host for his tenure, \"We love you, Dave. We really do.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01\"></div> More from Politics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-05T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-05T17:53:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
