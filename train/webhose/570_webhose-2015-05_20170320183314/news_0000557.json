Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota, who shared a stage with Obama in Massachusetts on Monday at the opening of an institute dedicated to the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. Noting that Obama visited Mount Rushmore, located in South Dakota, as a candidate in 2008 -- but hasn't returned since -- Daschle said the demands of the President's schedule had probably prevented him from making a stop while in office, though he had some suggestions for potential venues. \"I think it would be great if he could visit an Indian reservation. We have nine of them. I think he'd get a warm welcome, to say the least,\" Daschle said. Obama did visit an Indian reservation last year, but it was in North Dakota, not South. South Dakota, though not on Obama's presidential itinerary, did play an important role getting him to the White House. It was after the state's primary in 2008 that Obama officially clinched the Democratic nomination; while Hillary Clinton won South Dakota, the number of delegates Obama took from his second-place finish put him over the nomination threshold. Bill Clinton visited the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota's Badlands during the last year of his presidency. Since the beginning of 2015, Obama has knocked a few states off his list: Idaho, where he ventured in a post-State of the Union tour of red states; South Carolina, which he hadn't returned to since winning the state's Democratic primary in 2008; and, on Friday, Utah, where he'll deliver an address on the economy.
