That prompted a complaint from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. \nAfter his acquittal, Blunt said he blew smoke into the chameleon's mouth because it seemed to calm the aggressive reptile. \nThe Chicago Tribune reports (http://trib.in/1HM9Ihx ) Blunt said he hopes to get the chameleon back from Chicago Animal Care and Control. \n___ \nInformation from: Chicago Tribune, http://www.chicagotribune.com Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-28T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-28T03:16:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
