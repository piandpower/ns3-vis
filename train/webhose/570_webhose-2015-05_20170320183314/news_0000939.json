EPA is attempting to \"force states into shuttering coal-fired power plants\" in an effort to drive the nation away from fossil fuels and other traditional sources of energy, Pruitt said.\nOklahoma and West Virginia are among 15 coal-reliant states that are suing the EPA to block the so-called \"Clean Power Plan,\" which would require states to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent by 2030.\nThe EPA rule is a centerpiece of Obama's efforts to reduce the pollution linked to global warming. Power plants are the largest source of greenhouse gases in the U.S., accounting for about a third of the annual emissions that make the U.S. the second-largest contributor to global warming on the planet.\nEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and other administration officials say the plan gives states flexibility to meet broad goals set by the government. \"Each state is different, so each goal and each path can be different,\" McCarthy said when the plan was proposed last year.\nBut Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said EPA is \"dictating to states\" and \"micromanaging\" their energy-policy decisions. \"At risk is the ability that states have always had to make decisions about their electricity generation,\" she said.\nCapito, who chaired Tuesday's subcommittee meeting, said West Virginia has \"chosen to rely on coal to provide affordable and reliable electricity\" and has one of the lowest electricity rates in the nation.\n\"Other states make different choices that best serve their citizens. But under the Clean Power Plan, each state's electricity plan would have to meet EPA's criteria for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and be approved by EPA,\" she said.\nWith the economy still in recovery, \"the last thing job creators need is another expensive regulation likely to drive up energy prices,\" Capito said. \"And the last thing our families and senior citizens need is to see their electric bills continue to go up.\"\nCapito said she will introduce a bill next week to block the EPA plan, one of several proposals in Congress to delay or defeat the plan.\nAdvertisement\nTrending in Politics 1 Reid throws brakes on Obama trade push 2 States wasting millions by keeping ineligible recipients on ObamaCareâ€™s Medicaid rolls, critics say 3 Hillary flips for amnesty 4 Feds to regulate Christmas lights 5 Lindsey Graham: 'New phase in the war' if ISIS directed Texas attack See all Trends Advertisement", "external_links": ["http://www.ap.org/"], "published": "2015-05-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-05T22:27:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
