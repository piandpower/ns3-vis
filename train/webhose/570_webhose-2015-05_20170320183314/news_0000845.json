He faces a potential life prison sentence. Sentencing is set for July 30.\nProsecutors say Bryan hired his friend Matthew Allen Hall-Davis to kill 21-year-old Shamari Jenkins, who was fatally shot in Hartford in April 2013. Prosecutor Donna Mambrino said Bryan became angry and orchestrated a plan to have Jenkins killed after his efforts to get her to have an abortion failed.\nHall-Davis was convicted of murder and weapons charges. He was sentenced to 70 years in prison earlier this month.\nAdvertisement\nTrending in U.S. 1 Jailhouse Crock: Unfinished prison costs Detroit area taxpayers $1.2M per month 2 Woman, boy most recent homicides in Baltimore as city sees deadliest month in years 3 Texas student sues after college bans gun rights sign 4 Uproar over photo showing Chicago cops posing with black man wearing deer antlers 5 Police dog saves partner’s life after ambush attack in Mississippi woods ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-29T03:16:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
