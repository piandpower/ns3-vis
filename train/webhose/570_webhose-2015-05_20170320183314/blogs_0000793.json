His death under mysterious circumstances angered the community and led to violent protests, including looting and fires, after his funeral earlier this week. \nObama says justice needs to be served and all the evidence needs to be presented. He says the individuals facing charges are entitled to due process. \nHe added that what the people of Baltimore want most is the truth. \nObama commented during a media availability at the White House.
