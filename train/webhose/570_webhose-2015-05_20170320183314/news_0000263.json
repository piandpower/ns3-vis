ADVERTISEMENT It’s the first peer-reviewed scientific research into the proposed regulation, and it could give a big boost to the Obama administration and the rule’s supporters.\n“If EPA sets strong carbon standards, we can expect large public health benefits from cleaner air almost immediately after the standards are implemented,” Jonathan Buonocore, a research fellow at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and a co-author of the paper, said in a statement. \nThe coal industry shot back, saying that the study discounted the negative health effects of reduced electric reliability and higher energy costs that would come with the EPA’s rule. \nRead more here . \nON TAP TUESDAY I: Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey will testify before a Senate panel on the legal issues surrounding the Obama administration’s climate rule. \nThe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee’s Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee hearing comes after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) raised questions about the legality of the Clean Power Plan during a hearing with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy last week. \nOklahoma and West Virginia are among the handful of states suing the EPA over the proposed rule. \nON TAP TUESDAY II: The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will convene a hearing on how the federal government manages wildfires on the land it owns and how it could improve firefighting. The panel will hear from United States Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell and a group of experts and stakeholders in wildfire management and forestry. \nRest of Tuesday’s agenda … \nNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association scientists hold a media briefing on climate change in the Arctic. \nAROUND THE WEB: \nIn a win for environmentalists, Seattle officials said Monday that the city’s lease with the Port of Seattle does not allow Royal Dutch Shell to keep its Arctic Ocean drilling equipment there, as it had planned to do this summer, the Seattle Times reports . \nNew York State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos (R), who was arrested Monday , allegedly wanted the state to allow hydraulic fracturing so that it could write regulations to benefit a pollution filtering company where his son worked, Capital New York reports. \nOne-third of British Catholics surveyed said they would adopt a greener lifestyle if Pope Francis makes a statement on climate change, as he is expected to do soon. \nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT: \nCheck out Monday’s stories … \n-Energy Dept hands out LED research funds -Academics give boost to Obama climate rule-Schumer wants faster oil train changes than Obama-Key climate change goal may be missed -SCOTUS takes up appeal on energy rule-Biofuel policy delays lead to $13.7B investment ‘ shortfall ’-US oil executives to travel to Iran-Greens pounce on research linking drilling to quakes \nPlease send tips and comments to Timothy Cama, tcama@thehill.com ; and Devin Henry, dhenry@thehill.com .
