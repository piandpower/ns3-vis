Those arrangements protect the national security of the United States,” she added. ADVERTISEMENT Frifield's letter comes after Royce wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry on April 29, alleging that the transfer to Uruguay “appears to be inconsistent with U.S. law.\" Royce said Uruguay \"has not taken steps to mitigate the risk” the half-dozen detainees pose to U.S. national security.\nFrifield noted that the State Department had already briefed Royce’s staff on the December 2014 transfer and would be willing to provide the same briefing to the lawmaker. \nThe latest controversy over Guantánamo detainees comes as President Obama has been stepping up his efforts since late last year to shutter the controversial facility and fulfill his 2008 campaign pledge. \nTransfers from the facility have reduced the population at Guantánamo to 122 prisoners, the smallest number in years. \nThe moves infuriated Republican lawmakers, and they are digging in their heels to keep the facility open. \nThis week, the House will vote on a fiscal 2016 defense policy bill that adds more restrictions on the administration's ability to transfer detainees housed at the Guantánamo Bay, language the White House opposes.
