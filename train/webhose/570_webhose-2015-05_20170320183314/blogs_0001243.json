Several of these lawmakers also warned the vote could turn women away from the GOP. ADVERTISEMENT It’s unclear how the new bill will be changed compared to the old one.\nThe bill's two leading sponsors, Reps. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) have been working to tweak it. \nThe vote is set to take place on May 13, the two-year anniversary of the conviction of Kermit Gosnell, a doctor convicted of killing three infants who were born alive during attempted abortion procedures. \n“We are thankful to our pro-life allies on the Hill, including House GOP leadership and the Congressional Pro-Life Women’s Caucus, who have tirelessly worked to bring this bill to a vote,” Susan B. Anthony president Marjorie Dannenfelser wrote in a statement. \nPast: 1 day State Dept: Clinton's personal... “I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable.\" The GOP’s new case against...
