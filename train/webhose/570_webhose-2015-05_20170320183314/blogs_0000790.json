The amount included funding for 276 awards, and the website reports that the spending had created 290 jobs in the fourth quarter in 2013. \nOf this amount, $467.1 million went to education; $206.1 million to the environment; $24 million to \"family\"; $16.1 million to infrastructure; $15.2 million to transportation; $11.9 million to housing; and $3.1 million to job training.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-04T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-04T15:09:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
