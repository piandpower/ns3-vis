The President's actions are in line with those of previous Presidents -- including Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush -- and I am fully confident that they are constitutional -- a view widely held in the legal community.\nImmigrants are integral to the strength of our nation. They deserve comprehensive reform that will provide a pathway to citizenship and ensure that families aren't torn apart. At the very least, they should have the protection of these common sense executive actions. I eagerly await a court decision that will allow these executive actions to be implemented, and I will continue to do everything I can to make comprehensive immigration reform a reality.\nFollow Rep.
