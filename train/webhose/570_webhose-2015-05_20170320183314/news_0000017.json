E.U. officials have requested the U.S. lower the borrowing limits to what the Europeans have put in place, which so far American officials have refused to do. \"This is hardly a hypothetical possibility,\" she said on Tuesday, because the U.S. is \"already deep into negotiations\" with the E.U. and \"big banks on both sides of the Atlantic are gearing up to use that agreement to water-down financial regulations.\" RELATED: Obama sells trade deal to House Democrats When asked about how personal this fight has become, Obama said , \"you know, the truth of the matter is that Elizabeth is a politician like everybody else, and she's got a voice that she wants to get out there.
