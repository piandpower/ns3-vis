ADVERTISEMENT Key revealed that the pair only had 10 minutes of rehearsal time and that the White House penned the wisecracks for the well-received sketch.\nWhen asked if Obama should try his hand at acting after leaving the White House, Key replied, “I think he should. I think he could make a run at Denzel’s spot,” referring to Oscar winner Denzel Washington. \nBut Key suggested with a smile that Obama might need to first bulk up before becoming Hollywood's next action star, saying the president should, “Put on a few more pounds, because he’s kind of thin.” Past: 1 day Report: Obama lied about bin Laden...
