Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) described abortion procedures after five months of pregnancy as \"the greatest human rights atrocity in the United States today.\" \nThe House is expected to pass the legislation late Wednesday afternoon. GOP leaders resurrected the legislation after yanking it from the floor in January to due an intraparty dispute over exemptions for rape. ADVERTISEMENT The previous version of the bill only allowed exceptions for rape if the crime had been reported to police. But GOP centrists and women objected to the language, which has since been removed from the legislation.\nFranks argued that voting against the legislation would be unconscionable. \n\"This is a vote all of us will remember forever and it will be considered in the annals of history, and I believe the counsels of eternity itself. But it shouldnâ€™t be such a hard vote. Protecting little pain capable unborn children and their Mothers is not a Republican issue, or a Democrat issue, it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as human family,\" Franks said on the House floor. \n\"I would submit to you that the winds of change are now beginning to blow and that the tide of blindness and blood is finally turning in America. Because today, we are poised to pass the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in this chamber,\" Franks said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-13T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-13T22:21:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
