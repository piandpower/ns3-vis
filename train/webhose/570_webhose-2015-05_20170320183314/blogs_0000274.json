Obama signed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, White House press secretary Josh Earnest announced in a statement late in the evening. ADVERTISEMENT The House easily passed the bill with a vote of 420-3 earlier this month. It was a far different story in the Senate, where the bill languished for weeks before getting approved 99-0 last month. The legislation aimed at curbing sex trafficking crimes stalled in the Senate after Democrats argued abortion language in the bill expanded a restriction on using federal funds for abortion. An eventual deal required funding for victims of trafficking to come from two sources â€” criminal fines levied on perpetrators and money previously appropriated by Congress Debate over the bill prolonged a vote to confirm Loretta Lynch, Obama's pick for attorney general. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he wouldn't allow members to leapfrog over the bill to confirm Lynch. She was eventually sworn in April 27. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced the legislation in the Senate. Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) introduced its companion legislation in the House.
