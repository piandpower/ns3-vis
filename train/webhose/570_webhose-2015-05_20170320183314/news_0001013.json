The interview ran on May 20 on FoxNews.com Live: \n“I would think that a White House counsel would give a heads up to the president, to the chief of staff, to the press secretary, to those three people, to at least prepare for a crisis management plan, a media plan, Q & As just to get it ready so that they can be out in front as soon as the news hit. \nThat’s what I would have recommended and I was surprised when I heard the president say that he hadn’t been given any knowledge or heads up. \nHUNT: So was the president failed by his White House Counsel? \n“It is a failure of crisis management, it is not a moral failure or even a political failure, but the crisis management technique here is to be ready so that he can be out front first when the news hits. It took him about 48 hours to really get out and express the outrage that he did so effectively and I would have had him right at the first minute of the news story if [White House Counsel] Ms. Ruemmler had informed him they would have been all ready with a crisis plan, which is both political and media messages so that they are ready right as the news hits. \n... \nGood crisis management serves the president well by getting out in front of these stories even if they are not hurting him politically. \nIn the case of the White House Counsel I have nothing but the highest respect for her legal abilities, I am merely and respectfully suggesting that that job requires somebody who is media sensitive and politically sensitive as well as legal skills. \nAnd I am respectfully suggesting that if she did know about this investigation, even without knowing any conclusions, that she has a direct line to the president -- it is one of the most senior positions in the White House. She should have given him a heads up and gone to [White House Press Secretary] Jay Carney and said, 'let’s do a crisis management plan so as soon this IG report is public we’ll be first and have the president get out in front.'\" \nLanny Davis, a Washington attorney and principal in the firm of Lanny J.
