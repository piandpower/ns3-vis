Forgive me for being blunt, but throughout history this has previously been accompanied by execution by guillotine, firingsquad, public hanging . \nThe board acknowledged that the final paragraphs of the letter were \"inescapably an incitement to have the chief executive of our government executed.\" \n\"They should have been deleted,\" the board wrote. \nThe Daily Item did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Read the full apology here .
