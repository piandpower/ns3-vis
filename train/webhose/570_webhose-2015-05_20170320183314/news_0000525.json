O'Reilly said that Obama does acknowledge there have been \"setbacks.\" \nO'Reilly stated that all presidents should deal with problems in the here and now. \n\"I mean it's fine to want a cleaner planet. I do. And it's good to explore ways to eliminate harmful emissions. Every sane person supports that,\" he said. \"But to tell a group of military graduates that climate change is a defense priority borders on delusion.\" \nO'Reilly stated that most Americans understand that Obama has an \"aversion to using U.S. power to right wrongs in the world.\" \n\"Yes, he gave the order to get Bin Laden and he uses drones to kill terror leaders. I give him credit for that,\" O'Reilly said. \"But the Middle East is aflame, yet there's the president is urging the Coast Guard and other military branches to contemplate climate change.\" \nWatch the full Memo above. \nYou Might Also Like...
