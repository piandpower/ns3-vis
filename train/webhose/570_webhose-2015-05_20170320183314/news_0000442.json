Elijah Cummings of Maryland, marked the one-year anniversary by accusing the GOP-created committee of wasting $3 million in an effort to go after Clinton. \"After a full year, it now seems obvious that this investigation is being dragged out in order to attack Secretary Clinton and her campaign for president -- squandering millions of taxpayer dollars in the process -- while Republicans use this tragedy to raise campaign funds,\" Cummings said. \"This is exactly the opposite of what we promised the victims' families, and I urge the Select Committee to drop this political charade and focus on implementing reforms that will protect our diplomatic corps around the world.\" Photos: Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi 22 photos Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi – Attackers set the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, on fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially thought the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video, made in the United States, that mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. But the storming of the mission was later determined to have been a terrorist attack.
