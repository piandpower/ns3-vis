(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) | ASSOCIATED PRESS reddit \nMONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Abortion clinics would be prohibited near schools under legislation approved by the Alabama House. It would force one of the state's five abortion clinics to move or close. \nThe House of Representatives on Tuesday voted 79-15 for the proposal to ban clinics within 2,000 feet of a public K-12 school. The state would not license or renew a license for clinics within that distance. The bill now moves to the state Senate, where it faces an uncertain outlook with five meeting days remaining in the legislative session. \nRep. Ed Henry, R-Hartselle, said the clinics are not appropriate near children, nor are clinic protests, which he said can include graphic statements from \"both sides\" and photos of aborted fetuses, \nOpposing lawmakers called the bill an attempt to close an abortion clinic.
