Hide Caption 35 of 35 Story highlights Roxanne Jones: Michelle Obama's remarks to Tuskegee graduates that racial bias still affects how black people are treated were correct She says the first lady expressed truth about ignorant stereotypes that Americans must confront if they are ever to be fixed Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as aproducer and as a reporter at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. She was named a 2010 Woman of the Year by Women in Sports and Events. Jones is a co-author of \"Say It Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete\" and CEO of the Push Marketing Group. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) My mom is an old-school Baby Boomer. She likes to color-coordinate her outfits to make sure they match head to toe -- accessories and all. And though I long ago rebelled against this traditional fashion sense, there's no denying that she always looks good, even to my Gen-X eye for mismatched fashion. Back when she was in the thick of her battles against a nearly fatal bout of cancer, Mom refused to leave the house looking defeated. Roxanne Jones Which is why I was so taken aback one afternoon during a mother-daughter outing when I heard an older white woman in the ladies' room say to my mom: \"Wow, you people look so good in all those colors. You girls are always so colorful. If I wore so many colors, I'd look awful.\" When I look at my mom, I see a proud, stylish, strong woman. One who has earned the right not to be called \"girl.\" One who is not \"you people.\" But that woman with her backhanded, condescending compliment looked at my mother and saw only her blackness, and all of ignorant stereotypes that have been passed down through the generations. Mom to her was just another colorful, exotic Negro woman to be observed like the newest zoo exhibit. She didn't actually see my mother at all. Like many of us, First Lady Michelle Obama understands too well what it's like to be taunted by racial insults and daily slights, as she told the 2015 graduating class at Tuskegee University recently. The trick, she said, is to not let the detractors define you, or limit your success.
