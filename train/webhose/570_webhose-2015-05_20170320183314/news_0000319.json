Do you know what worries me? Or worse, even scares me?\nThings like this. Here is what a senior military official said last week about the fight against ISIS, also known on Arabic shorthand as \"Daesh.\"\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBRIG. GEN. THOMAS WEIDLEY, CHIEF OF STAFF, COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE, OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE: We firmly believe Daesh is on the defensive throughout Iraq and Syria, attempting to hold previous gains while conducting small-scale localized harassing attacks.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nHe said ISIS - Daesh - was on the defensive. If they are on the defensive, that means we are winning, right? Well, less than three days later, ISIS is hanging its ugly black flag in triumph over Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's largest province. And joint Chief's of Staff Chairman General Martin Dempsey releases a statement calling the fall of Ramadi a serious \"setback.\"\nThat's a serious setback? That's it? Ask yourself this: How many setbacks is it going to take for the Pentagon to admit the Obama military strategy isn't working? First Fallujah, then Mosul and now Ramadi. They think it's just a setback? Oh, brother!\nEither the Pentagon is completely out of the loop or flat-out lying to us. Either one, lying or out of the loop, is terrifying for our Pentagon. We're in trouble, right?\nThat's my \"Off the Record\" comment tonight.\non-the-record On the Record , hosted by Greta Van Susteren, airs on Weekdays at 7PM ET on Fox News Channel.\nMore on this show Advertisement\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-20T22:21:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
