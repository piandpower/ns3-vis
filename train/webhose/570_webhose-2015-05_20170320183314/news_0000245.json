So, it's official. After years of signing \"-BO\" at the end of @BarackObama t o signal the tweets he crafted himself from an account operated by the Organizing for Action staff, the President now has his very own handle @POTUS , tweeting for the first time: \"Hello, Twitter! It's Barack. Really! Six years in, they're finally giving me my own account.\" Hello, Twitter! It's Barack. Really! Six years in, they're finally giving me my own account. — President Obama (@POTUS) May 18, 2015 For his banner photo, the President chose a powerful image from the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches, where he, first lady and Congressman John Lewis (D-Georgia) led a commemorative march, hand in hand, over the Selma Bridge. Per a statement from t he White House , the @POTUS handle \"will serve as a new way for President Obama to engage directly with the American people, with tweets coming exclusively from him.\" Naturally, folks on social are having a little fun with this new presidential social presence: The bear is loose on the Twittersphere! Welcome to the interwebs, Mr. President. https://t.co/SrlAbK3rfK — Valerie Jarrett (@vj44) May 18, 2015 . @POTUS joined Twitter just in time to live tweet The Bachelorette premiere tonight. — Erin Ruberry (@erinruberry) May 18, 2015 I'm going to enjoy the brief 10 minute period where I have more Twitter followers than @POTUS . pic.twitter.com/w28RPLGY09 — Byron Tau (@ByronTau) May 18, 2015 And Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy tweeting a gif of the President with a selfie stick: Welcome to twitter @POTUS ! Looking forward to lots of Presidential selfies pic.twitter.com/jjWnkwX14h — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) May 18, 2015 And some asking the question on a lot of people's minds, what happens to the handle when a new President takes office? Does the @POTUS handle stay at the WH though? Whoever is in the Oval Office gets it? Like the @PressSec handle? So many questions. — Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) May 18, 2015 In the meantime, we'll just wait for your first GIFs and selfies, Mr. President.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-05-18T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-05-18T19:48:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
