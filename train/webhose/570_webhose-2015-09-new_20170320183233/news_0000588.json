The President will \"trek through the wilderness\" with survival expert Grylls, in the special edition of the show, set to air later this year according to a press release. Obama will meet with the host in Alaska to observe the effects of climate change on the state and will also explore the Alaskan wilderness while testing his survival skills. Celebrities including Kate Winslet, Channing Tatum and Drew Brees have participated in the show featuring one-on-one adventures. Obama begins his Alaska trip Monday where he will try to call attention to Alaska as a kind of climate change ground zero, including a hike on a melting glacier near the town of Seward and his visit with a fisherman in the remote coastal village of Dillingham. To maximize the impact of the historic trip, which will make Obama the first sitting U.S. President to visit the arctic, the White House has said it plans to devote all of the resources of its potent social media operation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T01:05:04.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
