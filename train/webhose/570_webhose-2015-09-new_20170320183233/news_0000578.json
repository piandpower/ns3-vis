That cooperation and diplomacy will not work.\"\nMany Republicans have slammed Obama's foreign policy approach, criticizing the Democrat for not taking a hard enough stance on aggressive Russian actions in the world and for failing to curtail the rise of China.\nAnd Republican candidates running for president have nearly unanimously called for strengthening the U.S. military, favoring a stronger approach to defeating ISIS and to confronting the U.S.'s enemies in the world.\nThe Republicans have also strongly opposed the nuclear deal Obama brokered with Iran, with several Republican presidential contenders vowing to tear up the deal if they become president. Obama has framed opposition to that deal as favoring a military solution over a diplomatic consensus.\nIn his speech Monday, Obama also defended the deal and the international process he used to achieve it.\n\"After I took office, I made clear that one of the principal achievements of this body -- the nuclear non-proliferation regime -- was endangered by Iran's violation of the NPT,\" he said, referring to the treaty governing that regime. \"On that basis, the (U.N.) Security Council tightened sanctions on the Iranian government, and many nations joined us to enforce them. Together, we showed that laws and agreements mean something.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-09-29T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:12:23.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
