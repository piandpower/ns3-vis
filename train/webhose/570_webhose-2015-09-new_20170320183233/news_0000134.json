It also came hours after Trump posted a video on his Instagram account drawing on a 2013 clip of Bush's mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, saying, \"We've had enough Bushes.\" Bush has been more vocal lately, insisting that Trump is not a true conservative while touting his own record implementing conservative policies as Florida's governor. Trump has responded with more attacks of his own, repeatedly calling Bush \"low energy\" on the campaign trail. In a video posted online two weeks ago, Trump chimed in again with his trademark, \"No more Bushes\" in an Instagram mashup of former Presidents George H.W. and George W. Bush, father and brother to Jeb Bush. Trump responded to the Bush campaign video, saying, \"Even this video is boring.\" \"He is doing so poorly in the polls that he is now starting to spend some of the money that his 'bosses' -- special interests and lobbyists -- have given him to attack me,\" Trump said via a statement distributed by his spokeswoman. \"The last thing this country needs is a low-energy president without any substance or any ideas on how to Make America Great Again.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> Race to the White House More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T19:10:49.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
