He also approved offshore drilling for a Shell rig. His climate activist friends (like Tom Steyer) can't seem to bring themselves to go against Obama's hypocritical decisions and and say they like his overall agenda and so they stand behind him and ignore things that go against their principles. So that translates into they are OK with the drilling. Once again we see how any Democrat that gets to sit with Obama compromises their own ideology. Anybody want to guess there are green energy lobbyists involved with the easily bought environment activists? http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/when-climate-change-attacks Kerry wants to link it to terrorism like O'Malley did recently. They say what happens when Europe runs out of water? I say it will probably rain and then what? After all, climate always changes. So silly. TAGS: What do you think of this story?
