ADVERTISEMENT Trump added that Obama’s skill on the links has improved since becoming president in 2008, the newspaper reported.\n“I’d love to play him for the presidency,” he reportedly said of the president. \n“His swing looks like [it’s] coming along beautifully, his game looks much better,” Trump added. \nThe real estate mogul also said on Wednesday that he would not rate former Gov. Jeb Bush’s (R-Fla.) skills anywhere near the same level on the golf course, according to the Post . \n“I’d love to play Jeb for the presidency,” he said of his rival for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. \n“That would be even easier than running against him in politics.\" \nTrump is an avid golfer whose corporation owns multiple courses worldwide. \nHe touted his prowess with a golf club earlier this month, attacking Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another GOP 2016 rival. \n“Recently, Rand Paul called me and asked me to play golf,” Trump said on Aug. 13. “I easily beat him on the golf course and will even more easily beat him now, in the world of politics. \n“Sen. Paul has no chance of winning the nomination and the people of Kentucky should not allow him the privilege of remaining their senator,” the outspoken billionaire added. \n“Rand should save his lobbyists’ and special interest money and just go home.\" \nTrump also conducted a press conference at his Turnberry golf course in Ayrshire, Scotland, last month. \n“I think the world would unite if I were leader of the United States,” he told reporters, adding that he would “get along very well” with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nTrump’s boasts about his golf game come as he leads the GOP presidential field in multiple national polls. \nThe latest RealClearPolitics average of samplings has the New Yorker leading the Republican field with 26.5 percent support. \n—This story was updated at 1:07 p.m. Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T05:08:47.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
