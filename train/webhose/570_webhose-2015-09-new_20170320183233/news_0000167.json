It's called Muslims,\" said the first man Trump called on to ask a question. \"We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.\" \nTrump, who was a driver of the \"birther\" movement that claimed Obama wasn't born in the U.S, first responded with feigned exasperation — \"We need the question,\" he said, to laughs — but let the man continue. \n\"We have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question,\" the questioner continued. \"When can we get rid of it?\" \nTrump did not dispute the man's assertions and said he'd heard others raise the issue. \n\"We're going to be looking at a lot of different things. And you know, a lot of people are saying that, and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there,\" said Trump. \"We're going to be looking at that and plenty of other things.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T15:29:47.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
