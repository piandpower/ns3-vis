Obama and his team of advisers will stay at New York’s Palace Hotel instead. ADVERTISEMENT The move has long been rumored, but was made official on Friday. State Department spokesman Mark Toner told the AP the decision was made “to take into account changing circumstances” including “possible security concerns.”\nU.S. fears about Chinese espionage have spiked following a major hack of the Office of Professional Management, which exposed sensitive personal data belonging to millions of government workers. China is widely believed to have been behind the hack. \nIn response, the Obama administration is reportedly weighing sanctions against Chinese interests or companies. The issue of cybersecurity is expected to be a focal point of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to the U.S. later this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:02:01.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
