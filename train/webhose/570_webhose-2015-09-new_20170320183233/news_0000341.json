ADVERTISEMENT By taking action to officially name the 20,000-foot peak Denali, Obama will take the Alaskan Natives side in a dispute that has stretched on for more than a century.\n“Generally believed to be central to the Athabascan creation story, Denali is a site of significant cultural importance to many Alaska Natives,” the White House said in a Sunday fact sheet. “The name ‘Denali’ has been used for many years and is widely used across the state today.” \nAlaska first formally requested the change in 1975. \nIt has often been a bipartisan legislative priority among Alaska’s congressional delegation to rename the mountain. Lisa Murkowski (R), the state’s senior senator and chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which is responsible for the matter, has sponsored legislation in every session of Congress to do so since taking her seat. \nAt a hearing about the Denali bill in June, Murkowski said renaming the mountain “seems a fitting gesture and an appropriate way to honor the culture and history of Alaska Natives.” \n“There is no need for this name confusion and controversy to continue,” she said. \nAt the same hearing, Victor Knox, the associate director for planning, facilities and lands at the National Park Service, which manages the mountain and surrounding area, said the Obama administrative respects the history of Denali and would not object to Murkowski’s legislation. \nEfforts to rename the mountain have often faced strong opposition from Ohio and its congressional delegation in an attempt to preserve the honor of William McKinley. The 25th president was a presidential candidate when a gold prospector first named the peak after him. \nThe White House’s announcement did not specify how Obama and Interior Secretary Sally Jewell will assert authority to change the mountain’s name without approval from Congress. \nObama announced the action as part of a series of efforts to improve outreach to Alaska Natives. He will meet Monday in Anchorage to discuss the efforts with Alaska Native leaders and Gov. Bill Walker (I), Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott (D) and Murkowski. \nThe new actions include neighborhood revitalization funding for Anchorage, a native youth engagement program and wildlife management cooperation efforts.
