Thousands of people fled their homes at the peak of the fire, and two men remain missing, according to the Lake County Sheriff's Office on Tuesday.\nAuthorities are searching for Robert Litchman, 61, of Middletown and Robert Fletcher, 66, of Cobb.\nSheriff Brian Martin said at a news conference Tuesday that his office had received reports of 15 people missing since the fire started. All have been accounted for except the two men. \"We are hopeful these people are located and returned and reunited with their loved ones,\" he said.\nThe fire has claimed the lives of three people. The body of 72-year-old Barbara McWilliams, who used a walker, was found in her burned-down home. The others who died in the Lake County fire are 69-year-old former newspaper reporter Leonard Neft and 65-year-old Bruce Beven Burns.\nSeveral areas remained under evacuation more than a week after the fire's start as crews continue to clear debris and trees and restore damaged power lines.\nThe presidential disaster declaration allows residents and business owners to apply for grants for repairs and temporary housing as well as apply for low-cost loans for uninsured property.\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown requested disaster declarations for the fire in Lake County as well as another destructive wildfire in Calaveras and Amador counties, about 125 miles east of San Francisco. Federal officials are still working on the request for the other fire, said Kelly Huston, deputy director for the governor's Office of Emergency Services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T05:17:13.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
