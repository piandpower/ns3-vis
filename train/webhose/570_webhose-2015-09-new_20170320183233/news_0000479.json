Although a lot of journalists did. Second, you can say this is a guy who hasn't done town halls… I believe this is the second one he ever did, and a more practiced politician would have understood, or immediately sort of undermined and denied the premise.”\nHowever, Krauthammer said Trump may have trouble brushing it all off because he has questioned the president’s citizenship and religion in the past.\n“The problem is that Trump, he himself had trumpeted, if you like, the birther theories, the idea [President Obama] wasn't an American, he wasn't a Christian… and he hasn't, as far as I know, directly repented that,” Krauthammer said.\n“I think now he needs to answer that question, and he can simply say, 'I looked at the evidence, and I was wrong.' But he doesn't say that very easily,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T05:07:42.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
