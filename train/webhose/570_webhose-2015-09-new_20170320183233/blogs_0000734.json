Chris Christie (R-N.J.) said on Tuesday that President Obama’s actions are inspiring people to disregard the nation’s laws. \n“Whether it is New York, Chicago or San Francisco, it is happening everywhere,” he said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” \n“The president has encouraged this lawlessness,” the 2016 GOP presidential candidate added. “It is coming from the top.” \nChristie cited Obama's immigration policies as proof that the president is selective about which laws he enforces. \nThat approach, Christie added, is inspiring similar approaches to government at the state and city levels. \nChristie pointed to Colorado's lax marijuana laws and San Francisco's sanctuary policies concerning illegal immigrants as proof the nation needs stricter law enforcement. \nChristie also said that Americans are increasingly disenchanted with a government that does not always obey its own laws. \nHe said that voter dissatisfaction is boosting outsider presidential candidates like retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and real estate mogul Donald Trump. \n“The statement they’re making is that they’re incredibly angry at Washington,” Christie said of Trump and Carson supporters. \n“People in this country are getting more and more fed up,” he said. “They’re fed up with government. It’s time to get these people the hell out of Washington.” \nChristie currently ranks 10th in the GOP presidential field with 2.8 percent voter support nationwide, according to the latest RealClearPolitics average of national samplings.
