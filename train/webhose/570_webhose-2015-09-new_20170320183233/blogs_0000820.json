ADVERTISEMENT Obama called the law “one of our nation’s most influential pieces of legislation” for protecting the right of minorities to vote. But he warned the law has come under attack from GOP-backed laws requiring voters to provide identification at the polls.\n“In 2015 — there are still too many barriers to the vote, and too many people trying to erect new barriers to the vote,” he wrote in an op-ed on Medium. \n“They’re even written into the code of law in some parts of our country — provisions specifically designed to make it harder for some people to vote,” he added. \nThe president’s message is part of an all-day push calling for the renewal of the law, the core of which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. \nObama will hold a nationwide video conference to call for the renewal of the law. He will be joined by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and civil rights leaders. \nThe high court rolled back part of the law that required nine southern states with histories of racial discrimination to seek federal approval before they change their election laws. \nSince then, states such as North Carolina and Texas have adopted voter ID laws and curbed early voting. \nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) -- who is running for president – last year signed a voter ID law that has become a lightning rod issue on the campaign trail. \nRepublicans say the laws are needed to prevent voter fraud. But Democrats say the measures are aimed at suppressing the minority vote, and there is scant evidence of widespread voter fraud. \nObama’s push comes one day after a federal appeals court ruled that Texas’s voter ID law violated the Voting Rights Act, arguing it has a “discriminatory” effect on minorities. \nThe president will urge Americans to sign up to vote on National Voter Registration Day on Sept. 22, the White House said. He argued “there is no possible excuse” for sitting at home on Election Day. \n“As shameful as it is that laws are being designed to keep people away from the polls, here’s something just as troubling — if not worse: Among those of us who can vote, far too many of us choose not to,” he wrote. \nEarlier this week, Obama urged Democrats to watch Thursday night’s Republican debates so they can form rebuttals to their policies. \n“Listen carefully to what the Republican candidates for president say, and then hold them accountable for trying to undo all of the hard work we've done to move this country forward,” he wrote in an email to the Democratic National Committee. \nAsked whether the voting rights push was scheduled to counter the GOP debates, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday “one person’s irony is another person’s serendipity.” \n“Maybe there will be an opportunity for Republican candidates to discuss the right for every American to cast a vote,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T18:17:00.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
