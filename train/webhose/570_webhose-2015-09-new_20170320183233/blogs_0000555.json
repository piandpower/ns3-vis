Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon discussed Tuesday, during a meeting at the White House, the fight against climate change and the conflict in Syria, among other matters. \nObama, who turned 54 on Tuesday, and Ban met for approximately one hour. \nIn their statements to reporters after the meeting, both agreed on the urgency of taking action against climate change, the day after Obama warned that global warming is the greatest threat to future generations and U.S. national security, while presenting his plan for reducing   from power plants. \nThe Clean Energy Plan promoted by Obama calls on the United States to cut   from power plants by 32 percent by the year 2030 from the volume registered in 2005. \nObama's plan complements the general goal to which the United States has committed itself with a view to the global conference on climate change to be held in Paris next December. \nThat goal, formalized last March, calls on the United States to reduce by 2025 its greenhouse gas emissions - all of them, not just those from electric power plants - by between 26 and 28 percent compared with 2005. \nThe U.N. secretary-general on Monday praised Obama's plan for reducing emissions from power plants and said it will serve as an example that will encourage other countries to join in the effort to halt climate change.
