But there are provisions listed in the legislation which state that the collective/cooperative defense would remain in effect for one year after the powers that be announce they've started issuing medical marijuana business licenses.\nOnce the bills in question are finalized, rules still need to be formed in order to implement the legislation, and the state's legislature could quite plausibly amend some of its current provisions.\nStay tuned to The 420 Times for any updates regarding the legislation's progress.\nCheck out the free The 420 Times iPhone and iPad App on the iTunes Store and Android App available on Google Play.
