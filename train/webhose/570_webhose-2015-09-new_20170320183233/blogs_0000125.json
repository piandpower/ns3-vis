ADVERTISEMENT A White House official told a reporter traveling with President Obama during his vacation that the president toasted the civil rights activist at the Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs, Mass., “extolling his kindness and generosity.”\n“The president told attendees that Vernon's wisdom and enthusiasm are rare qualities,” the official added. \nFormer President Bill Clinton also toasted his long-time confidante. \nObama, Jordan and Clinton golfed together earlier in the day, along with Ron Kirk. \nHillary Clinton was expected to attend the party , setting up her first encounter with Obama since Clinton formally launched her campaign for president. The White House official who spoke to the press did not discuss any contact between Hillary Clinton and Obama, however. \nOther guests at Jordan's birthday party included actor Morgan Freeman, historian Henry Louis Gates and Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. \nPast: 1 day Crunch time for Joe Biden Time is running out for Biden to decide whether to run for president.
