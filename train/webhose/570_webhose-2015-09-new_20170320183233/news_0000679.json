In the past, some other Republicans -- including GOP front-runner Donald Trump -- have at times publicly doubted the President's heritage and faith.\nPaul said voters would nevertheless have an \"honest question\" about Muslims seeking the highest office.\n\"Do you believe literally that a woman should be stoned to death for adultery?
