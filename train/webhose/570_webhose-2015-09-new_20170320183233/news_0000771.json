Obama was joined by Secretary of State John Kerry, UN Ambassador Samantha Power and National Security Advisor Susan Rice.\nIn his remarks at the U.N. General Assembly on Monday, Castro was stern in his call for the U.S. to lift its embargo against his country.\nCastro also demanded that the U.S. return what he called the \"illegally occupied\" territory that houses the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, end unauthorized radio and television broadcasts into the country and compensate Cubans for \"the human and economic damage they still endure.\"\nThe White House has said in the past that as the administration works to close Guantanamo Bay, they have no plans to relinquish the site.\nA new era in U.S.-Cuba relations\nAn administration official on Tuesday also said that Castro's comments underscore that the two nations will have disagreements as they pursue a new relationship, citing the administration's calls for improvements of human rights in Cuba.\n6 photos: U.S., Cuba reopen embassies 6 photos: U.S., Cuba reopen embassies Dignitaries applaud as the Cuban flag is raised over a reopened embassy in Washington on Monday, July 20.

Hide Caption 6 of 6 At the United Nations on Saturday, Castro applauded the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. Castro also called the embargo, which only Congress can lift, an \"economic, commercial and financial blockade\" that brought hardship to the Cuban people and stood as the main obstacle to the country's economic development.\nEarlier this month the U.S. Departments of Treasury and Commerce announced revisions to existing Cuban sanctions, the third set of regulatory changes since the President's December announcement that the United States would re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba.\nRELATED: Obama announces re-establishment of U.S.-Cuba diplomatic ties\nU.S. and Cuban
