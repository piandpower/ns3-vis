Aren’t Muslims Americans as well? Don’t we have the right to religion in this country?” \nGood point, Don. \nLemon was discussing comments that a New Hampshire man made to Donald Trump at a rally on Thursday. \n\"We have a problem in this country. It's called Muslims. We know our current president is one,\" the man said. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed that Obama is a Muslim, responded in agreement. \nHowever, his campaign denies he was referring to Obama. \n\"Mr. Trump was referring to the need to protect Christians' religious liberties as his previous statement says and nothing more,\" a rep for Trump told NBC. \nWatch the full CNN segment above and see more of Trump's remarks below.
