General Assembly, expressing readiness to work with Russia and Iran to bring peace to Syria, even as he insisted that Syrian leader Bashar Assad cannot play a part in the country's future.\n\"I stand before you today believing in my core that we, the nations of the world, cannot return to the old ways of conflict and coercion,\" Obama said.\nHe recognized \"that diplomacy is hard; that the outcomes are sometimes unsatisfying; that it's rarely politically popular. But I believe that leaders of large nations, in particular, have an obligation to take these risks - precisely because we are strong enough to protect our interests if, and when, diplomacy fails.\"\nObama went on to say that \"the United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict\" in Syria.\nHowever, \"there cannot be, after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, a return to the pre-war status quo,\" he said, recalling that at the beginning of the Syrian conflict more than four years ago, \"Assad reacted to peaceful protest by escalating repression and killing and in turn created the environment for the current strife.\"\nObama demanded Assad's resignation from the beginning of the conflict, and on Monday insisted on a \"managed transition away from Assad and to a new leader, and an inclusive government...so that the Syrian people can begin to rebuild.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin spoke shortly after Obama at the U.N. and asked for support from the international community for the \"legitimate government\" of Syria, while Iran's Hassan Rouhani said over the weekend on CNN that \"everyone has accepted that President Assad must remain so that we can combat the terrorists\" of the Islamic State.\nThis afternoon at the U.N., Obama and Putin will discuss the Syrian crisis at their first formal meeting since the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis.\nWith regard to Cuba, Obama expressed conviction in his speech that change is coming to that country and defended the policy of diplomatic rapprochement undertaken last December, which led to the renewal of diplomatic ties and the reopening of embassies in Washington and Havana in July.\n\"I'm confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place anymore,\" he said.\n\"Change won't come overnight to Cuba, but I'm confident that openness, not coercion, will support the reforms and the better life the Cuban people deserve,\" he said.\nObama, who meets this Tuesday in New York with Cuban leader Raul Castro, said the U.S. \"will continue to stand up for human rights.\"\nThe renewal of diplomatic ties with Cuba was one of the examples chosen by Obama in his speech to defend his view that diplomacy is always preferable to conflict, the other example being the nuclear pact with Iran, about which he said that if it is fully implemented, \"a potential war is averted\" and \"our world is safer.\"\nOn the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, Obama said \"a different kind of leadership\" is required, and asked the world's leaders present this week at the annual U.N. General Assembly not to forget \"the lessons of the past.\"\nIn that context he mentioned the chaotic situation currently reigning in Libya and acknowledged that the international coalition that did away with the Moammar Gadhafi dictatorship in 2011 \"could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind.\" EFE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T07:25:20.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
