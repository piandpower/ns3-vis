It's called Muslims,\" the questioner said to Trump. \"We know our current president is one. You know he’s not even an American.\" \nThe Trump supporter continued, \"But anyway, we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That’s my question: When can we get rid of them?\" \nTrump responded, \"We’re going to be looking at a lot of different things. And you know, a lot of people are saying that, and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. We’re going to be looking at that and plenty of other things.\" \nHillary Clinton took notice, writing on Twitter that Trump's decision not to denounce the remark about Obama was \"disturbing and just plain wrong.\" \n\"Cut it out,\" she wrote. Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing, & just plain wrong. Cut it out. -H \n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 18, 2015 \nThe Trump campaign fired back, claiming that Obama is \"waging a war\" against Christians in America. \n“The media wants to make this issue about Obama,” Trump’s campaign said in a statement. “The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country. Christians need support in this country. Their religious liberty is at stake.” \nWatch registered Republican voters react in the clip above. \nYou might also be interested in...
