(CNN) During the motorcade on the National Mall, Pope Francis stopped to kiss babies and children. One young girl got through the barrier and handed the Pope a letter. At first, security stopped her, but the Pope signaled for her to come over. The crowd cheered as a guard lifted her to the Pope. In a video posted on The Guardian , the girl, identified as 5-year-old Sophie Cruz from Los Angeles, reads the letter. \"Pope Francis, I want to tell you that my heart is sad, and I would like to ask you to speak with the President and the Congress in legalizing my parents because everyday I am scared that one day they will take them away from me,\" she says. \"All immigrants just like my dad need this country,\" she says.

Her father, Raul, had a yellow T-shirt that read \"Papa Rescata DAPA!\", according to the Guardian. The T-shirt's message asks the Pope to save the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, a program that seeks to postpone deportation for undocumented parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Sophie Cruz is escorted away before being called over by the Pope. Wednesday, which began with pomp and politics and ended with a controversial canonization, was the Pope's first full day in the United States. The six-day visit will take him later this week to New York, where he will address the United Nations, and Philadelphia for the World Meeting of Families, a large Catholic event that is expected to draw nearly a million pilgrims to papal Masses.

Obama also gave the Pope a key from the Maryland home of Elizabeth Ann Seton, who was the first native-born U.S. citizen to become a saint. Not everyone is a Francis fan Outside the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, a group of protesters from the Women's Ordination Conference gathered as reporters and parishioners lined up for a glimpse of the Pope on Wednesday morning. Margaret Johnson led them in a song: \"Sister, Carry On.\" For the group from the Women's Ordination Conference, she said, it's become a rallying cry for what some hope will be a \"Catholic Spring\" pushing the church to treat men and women equally. \"When Pope Francis talks about the poor and people who suffer and discounts women in the same breath, his message is really without integrity,\" Johnson said. The massage therapist, who's also a board member of the group, said her involvement in the organization stemmed from the Vatican's censure of U.S. nuns in 2012.

I started to realize how injustice in the church is really so interconnected to injustice in the world,\" she said. \"When women are excluded from the Catholic Church, it morally sanctions the mistreatment of women around the world,\" she said. The organization hopes protesting near places where the Pope's appearing will help spread their message. \"We're hoping that this will inspire more people to speak out. We want more and more people to speak out. People who believe in equality are not alone,\" said Kate McElwee, co-executive director for international relations. Waiting on the Pope Father Rafael Barbieri, parochial vicar at St. Matthew, said parishioners have been very excited about the Pope's visit. \"It's basically like having the Pope coming to their homes,\" he said. At St. Matthew, he said, he's noticed a change since Francis became pontiff. \"Many people are coming back to the church because of the Pope,\" he said. \"People who once were far away from their faith, they're rediscovering the sacraments.\" Door just opened at Saint Matthew. Lots of anticipation that #PopeFrancis is near. #PopeInDC pic.twitter.com/syFmAvkbTY — Catherine Shoichet (@CatherineCNN) September 23, 2015 The Pope's message of mercy, he said, particularly resonates. \"To experience that God loves them but doesn't judge them.\" \"He's a source of inspiration to all of us.\" Hours before the Pope's arrival, parishioners from St. Matthew lined up outside for a chance to hear the prayer. \"I couldn't sleep last night, knowing that he was going to be with us,\" said Milton Saenz, 38, who works in catering at a nearby law firm and has been attending St. Matthew for five years. Next to him in line, Dolores Reyes, 58, was beaming as she wore a T-shirt that said: \"Caminando con el Papá Francisco.\" (Walking with Pope Francis.) \"He seems different. He is more humble, more connected with people, with everyone. He is a great Pope. I love his approach.\" Reyes, who does cleaning at a Catholic school, has been attending St. Matthew for 20 years, ever since she and her husband discovered the Spanish Mass there. Now she serves as an usher at the church. \"You can feel the love, the faith,\" Reyes said as she waited for her chance to catch a glimpse of Francis on Wednesday. But not everyone was happy about the Pope's arrival. Near the area where reporters were gathered to go through security, a group of protesters gathered, singing \"Sister, Carry On.\" The song, organizers said, has become a rallying cry for people pushing for a greater role for women in the Catholic Church. \"When Pope Francis talks about the poor and discounts women in the same breath, his message is really without integrity,\" said Margaret Johnson, a board member of the Women's Ordination Conference. — Catherine Shoichet (@CatherineCNN) September 23, 2015 'You only pope once' Thousands have been gathering between the Washington Monument and the White House since before dawn Wednesday, hoping for a glimpse of Pope Francis. It's a carnival-like atmosphere, with folks picnicking, singing, waving banners and Vatican flags. As in most papal visits, vendors are cashing in, selling everything from small Vatican flags to $10 T-shirts to buttons with the Pope's picture. The throngs are diverse: many immigrants and older people, but also millennials and young professional couples with small children. All of them had their bags checked and went through metal detectors. Pope Francis is offering hope & optimism, and challenging us to do better. Around the world, we're proud. #PopeInUSA pic.twitter.com/Ng2mgx0EmK — Vice President Biden (@VP) September 23, 2015 Bryanna Patinka, 18, a freshman at Catholic University, was with three classmates. They were practicing their \"papal selfies\" for when the pontiff goes by. \"I want to make sure I see him,\" she said. \"How many times can you say you saw the Pope,\" asked Olivia Donahue, 18. \"My mother texted me YOPO -- you only pope once!\" \"He's not a Trump or a Putin,\" Moira Shepard, 19, said of Francis' appeal. What to watch The Pope holds his first public events in Washington in Wednesday. All eyes are on Francis to see how deeply he will delve into politics. After a Rose Garden ceremony, Francis and President Barack Obama are expected to meet privately in the Oval Office. There are many issues on which both men agree -- and they seem, personally, to get along well. But there are also issues on which the Pope and President disagree, and it will be interesting to see the statements that emerge from the private meeting. Catholic Church sources are also keen to hear what Pope Francis will tell a big meeting of bishops Wednesday morning at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington. And in his last planned event on Wednesday, Pope Francis will canonize Junipero Serra at a large Mass outside Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. The canonization is a huge point of pride for Latino Americans, and Serra, an 18th-century missionary from Spain, will be the first saint ever canonized on American soil. But to Native Americans, Serra was no saint. They say he came to conquer and convert their communities. 5 photos: Few images exist of 18th-century Spanish missionary Junipero Serra, a founding figure of the American West. This portrait has become one of the standard representations of him and was done in the early 1900s by a Mexican priest, Father Jose Mosqueda, who said he copied it from a work that could have been an original portrait of Serra from the 1750s. Hide Caption 1 of 5 5 photos: This is Serra's personal \"novena\" prayer book, which is kept in the archives of Old Mission Santa Barbara. The first page is in Spanish. Hide Caption 2 of 5 5 photos: Here's another image of Junipero Serra from a first-edition book about the Spanish Franciscan friar entitled, \"Relacion Historica de la Vida y Apostolica Tareas del Venerable Padre Fray Junipero Serra,\" by Father Francisco Palou.

Hide Caption The Pope's ride What was that bulbous-looking car that whisked Pope Francis away from the tarmac on Tuesday? A Fiat 500L by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. In fact, the Pope is making good use of Fiat Chrysler wheels on his visit to the United States. The 500L is big brother to the more familiar Fiat 500 minicar. Prices start at about $20,000. Unlike the Fiat 500, which would have been entirely impractical for transporting a pope and his entourage, the 500L is large and roomy inside. Nice ride! The scoop from a papal insider Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, one of Pope Francis' closest advisers, will host his boss for a short visit starting Tuesday afternoon. As you might imagine, Wuerl has a few planning items on his plate, but CNN managed to catch him for a quick interview on Monday. This Q&A has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: The Holy Father's speech to Congress on Thursday is one of the most highly anticipated aspects of his visit to the United States. How deeply do you think he'll delve into U.S. politics? Cardinal Donald Wuerl: I suspect that the themes he touches on may be familiar ones, the ones we've heard him speak about so many times in \"The Joy of the Gospel\" and \"Laudato Si.\" I would also suspect that he's going to approach this as a pastor, a spiritual leader. He may point to certain problems and our moral obligation to resolve them, especially when they touch on the marginalized. But I would be very surprised if the Holy Father proposed any practical policies or laws. CNN: Already one congressman has said he plans to boycott Pope Francis' speech to Congress because he may speak about climate change. How would you respond to that? Wuerl: Nobody can really deny that there are serious problems (with the environment). We've been hearing for years about the depletion of the rainforest, the poor condition of water around the world and all the terrible famines. The Holy Father is saying we need to look at these and find a way to meet in the needs of human beings. CNN: The boycotting congressman, who is Catholic, said: \"When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one.\" How would you respond to that? Wuerl: I think the more helpful starting point is to face the issues, rather than addressing the alleged characteristics of the personality. CNN: What message is Pope Francis sending by canonizing Junipero Serra, the first saint to be canonized on U.S. soil and a Latino, in the nation's capital? Wuerl: There are a number of reasons for the canonization being here: First of all, it's where the Holy Father is going to be and we have the National Shrine of the Basilica here, as well as a large Spanish-speaking population. I don't think this is directed toward a political campaign or to specific candidates, but certainly no one can deny that from the very beginning, going back to all the discovery of America, the Spanish language has been part of our history. So I don't see why Hispanics would be considered latecomers. CNN: Before I let you go, what are you most looking forward to during the papal visit? Wuerl: I hear from so many young adults that they find in the Holy Father a reason to re-evaluate their religious lives, that they are starting to go to Mass again and reconnecting with the church. So, I'm quite excited about the impact of his visit. 23 photos: Pope Francis visits Cuba 23 photos: Pope Francis visits Cuba Security surrounds Pope Francis as makes his way to the Metropolitan Cathedral in Santiago, Cuba, on Tuesday, September 22.

Hide Caption 23 of 23 The Pope's 'cherry on the cake' In his last stop in Cuba, Pope Francis met with families at Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral in Santiago. He called the event the \"cherry on the cake\" and spoke about the importance of families. Francis said there's no perfect family, and it's OK for families to disagree. He said he's \"more afraid of those who say, 'We never argue.'\" Before heading to the airport, Francis offered up a blessing of the bellies. He asked all pregnant women to rub their bellies while he wished their unborn children good health. Pope soft on communism? During his trip to Cuba, Pope Francis took a few subtle jabs at the country's communist leadership. But he hasn't gone far enough for some American conservatives. Soon after landing, the Pope invoked a Cuban hero to criticize political dynasties , a remark that many interpreted as referring to the country's presidents for the last six decades, Raul and Fidel Castro. He also called for Catholics to be allowed more religious freedom. Some observers say Pope Francis's views on poverty and wealth make him a communist - is he? 📻 http://t.co/gvTOCxA9QX pic.twitter.com/la4LIv2seS — BBC World Service (@bbcworldservice) September 20, 2015 On Sunday, at a huge Mass in Havana's Revolution Square , Francis told 200,000 Cubans to serve people, not ideas, which again was seen as a \"subtle critique\" of Cuba's socialist revolution. But for the most part, the Pope has steered clear of overt political statements -- much more so than his predecessors, says veteran Vatican-watcher John Thavis . And some conservatives are accusing Francis of going soft on communism. During his trip to Cuba in 1998, St. John Paul II called for \"great change\" and urged greater respect for religious and other human rights, Thavis said. Pope Benedict XVI echoed that call in 2012. Aboard the papal airplane on the way to Cuba, Benedict said , \"It is obvious that the Marxist ideology as it was conceived no longer corresponds to reality: It is no longer possible to respond to or to build up a society in this way. New models must be found, patiently and constructively.\" Despite his frequent critiques of capitalism, Pope Francis says he is no Marxist. \"Marxist ideology is wrong,\" he told an Italian newspaper in 2013 . Thavis notes that the Pope could be critiquing communism behind the scenes in Cuba, in his meetings with Raul Castro. But it will be interesting to watch whether Francis -- who is rarely shy about sharing his political opinions -- will say anything to the Cuban people about the system they've endured since 1959. My prayer for this week: that Pope Francis embraces Capitalism. It's a long shot, but if he really wants to alleviate poverty, he will. — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) September 21, 2015 No meeting with dissidents At a briefing on Monday, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi took a question about whether the Pope would meet with dissidents before leaving Cuba. \"It's true that there were telephone calls from some people in the Nunciature, but there was no scheduled meeting, in the full sense of a one-on-one kind of talk,\" he said. Father Lombardi on #popefrancis meeting with dissidents.... Some calls were made from nunciature. https://t.co/DrXiQahjpU — Rosa Flores (@RosaFlores) September 21, 2015 The Pope goes off script Pope Francis wrapped up his weekend by going off script at two events in Havana on Sunday. During evening vespers, he called on society to protect the \"smallest\" and most vulnerable, including the unborn. Speaking spontaneously to a group of Cuban nuns, priests, seminarians and bishops, Francis said that \"Jesus shines\" in the lives of \"hidden\" and \"ignored\" people, such as those who suffer from degenerative diseases. Francis also referred to prenatal testing that can \"forecast\" illnesses in the womb, leading some parents to \"return it before it comes into the world.\" The Pope said he wanted to speak off the cuff in response to two \"prophets\" who spoke before him Sunday evening. One was a nun who works with severely ill children. Repeating a familiar theme, Francis also called for the church to embrace a \"spirit of poverty,\" saying that \"wealth takes away the best of us.\" Later Sunday evening, under a drizzle of rain, Francis urged a crowd of Cuban youth in Havana to \"open yourself and dream.\" \"Dream that if you give the best of yourself, you'll help make the world a different place.\" While avoiding overtly political statements, Francis also repeated his frequent criticism of a \"throwaway culture\" and the \"idolatry of money.\" Meeting with Fidel Castro Francis followed up the Mass on Sunday with a private meeting with former Cuban President Fidel Castro, the Vatican said. The two met in Castro's Havana residence and were joined by members of Castro's family. Francis and Castro exchanged books during what Lombardi described as a \"friendly and informal\" meeting. Pope Francis and Fidel Castro greet each other in Havana on Sunday. Castro presented Francis with the interview book \"Fidel & Religion.\" He wrote inside, \"For Pope Francis, on occasion of his visit to Cuba, with the admiration and respect of the Cuban people.\" Before hanging out with Castro, the Pope made his way through Havana in an open popemobile. He was greeted by throngs of cheering Catholics. Francis told those gathered at the Mass to pay attention to the call to serve and care for those who are the most vulnerable. A return to prayer for Raul Castro? Cuban President Raul Castro -- an atheist -- was among those in attendance at the Mass. After meeting with Francis at the Vatican in July, Castro said, \"If the Pope continues talking like this, I may return to the church and start praying again.\" CNN's Patrick Oppmann recently took a look at the pair's unlikely chemistry and what that could mean for Castro's faith.
