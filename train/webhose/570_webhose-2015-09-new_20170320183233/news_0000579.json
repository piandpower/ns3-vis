The White House said it would focus on Ukraine and getting Moscow to live up to a fragile peace plan. The Kremlin said Ukraine would be discussed only if time allowed, with Syria and the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS) dominating the discussions.\nThe latest measure of Russia's growing role in the war-torn region came Sunday, when the Iraqi military announced it would begin sharing \"\"security and intelligence\" information with Russia, Syria and Iran to help combat ISIS. Meanwhile, Moscow is ramping up its involvement in Syria in defense of its ally Bashar Assad, with activists saying that Russian soldiers on the ground in Syria.\nThe move could further complicate U.S. efforts to battle the extremists without working with Damascus and its allies. A U.S.-led coalition has been conducting aerial bombing campaigns against ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria, but U.S. officials insist they have no coordination with Tehran or Damascus on the matter.\nHours prior to their encounter, Obama and Putin will each have a chance to make their case to a broader audience of world leaders gathered in New York. Obama will address the body at approximately 10:30 a.m. ET Monday, with Putin scheduled to follow approximately one hour and 45 minutes later.\nObama is expected to emphasize the need for a political resolution to Syria's civil war that includes the ouster of President Bashar Assad, a Russian ally. Putin, meanwhile, is expected to argue that Assad's military is the most capable force for fighting ISIS and therefore needs to be strengthened.\nMore on this...
