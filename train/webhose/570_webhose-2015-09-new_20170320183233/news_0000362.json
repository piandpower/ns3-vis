Jamie Feldman Associate Style Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 09/29/2015 09:42 AM EDT \nThe only thing better than a Michelle Obama sighting is a Michelle Obama sighting that also includes Stephen Colbert. \nThe First Lady appeared on \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" Monday night, looking as chic as ever in a colorful, peplum top (with a lower cut than we're used to seeing her in!) and black pants. YouTube / The Late Show with Stephen Colbert \nWhen asked what FLOTUS looks forward to doing at the end of the term, her response was much more, well, human, than we anticipated. \n\"I want to do little things like, you know, open a window\" she said, garnering laughs from the audience and making us fall more in love with her than we were before. \nObama visited the show to talk about her #62MillionGirls initiative , which aims to create awareness around the fact that 62 millions girls around the world are not in school. \nFLOTUS announced the effort at the Global Citizen Festival on Saturday as part of her \"Let Girls Learn\" campaign , which works to ensure all girls have equal opportunity to proper education. The initiative is something she and Barack have always felt passionately about, and will continue to focus on once they leave the White House in 2016. \nObama also shared an adorable photo from her visit to the show on Instagram , thanking Colbert for his support of the campaign.
