Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., announced her support for the deal ahead of a speech on the agreement by Secretary of State John Kerry. She becomes the 34th senator to support the deal, giving President Obama enough backing to sustain a veto of a Republican bill opposing it, should that bill pass in a vote later this month.\n\"No deal is perfect, especially one negotiated with the Iranian regime,\" Mikulski said in a statement. \"I have concluded that this Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best option available to block Iran from having a nuclear bomb. For these reasons, I will vote in favor of this deal.\"\nOpposition to the agreement among Republicans, among ex-military leaders and in Israel remains widespread. But unless a supporter flips his or her vote, Obama would appear to have the crucial coalition in place to preserve the agreement in the congressional vote.\nKerry, meanwhile, is delivering what is billed as a major policy speech Wednesday in Philadelphia. He's also sending a letter to all members of Congress outlining U.S. security commitments to Israel and the Gulf Arab states in light of the nuclear deal.\nHis speech will focus on how, in their view, the international agreement makes the U.S. and its allies safer and how the deal is being mischaracterized by some opponents.\nMore on this...
