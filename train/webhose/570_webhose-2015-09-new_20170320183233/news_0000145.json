Published September 30, 2015 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nKanye West and President Obama will likely cross paths at an Oct. 10 Democratic National Committee fundraiser in San Francisco, but according a report, Kanye better keep his distance. \nAccording to Page Six, West, who announced his plans for a 2020 presidential bid at the MTV's Video Music Awards in August, has been strictly ordered to stick to performing only, meaning, presumably, he should avoid launching into one of his infamous rants. \nThe gossip site reports West has been ordered to refrain from giving Obama political advice. \n\"There will be restrictions,\" a source told Page Six . \"Kayne won't be able to lecture the president about how to run the country.\" \nNo word on if West will be allowed to talk to Obama at all at the event. Never one to avoid causing controversy, we'd guess the rapper may be eager to exchange a few words about the time the president called him a \"jackass\" on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" in 2012. \nWest will reportedly perform songs from his upcoming album, \"Swish,\" at the event. Tickets cost up to $10,000.
