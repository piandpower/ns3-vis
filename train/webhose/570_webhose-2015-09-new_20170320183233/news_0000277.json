She said she was concerned by the undercover filming by the Center for Medical Progress, which produced the edited clips.\n\"I think they should be investigated as to how they obtained those and doctored those and had them be accepted as something that was an indictment against Planned Parenthood.

But some House Democrats have called for Attorney General Loretta Lynch to similarly investigate the group.\nPelosi also praised Planned Parenthood's \"excellent\" leadership, singling out President Cecile Richards, who she said is \"a spectacular leader in our country.\"\nBut the top-ranking House Democrat said the Planned Parenthood officials in the videos -- some of which show employees casually discussing abortion -- should have been more careful with their language.\n\"They spoke in a way that could be misinterpreted,\" she said.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T20:20:45.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
