It has been hard, in one sense, because I’m prepared to accept de fide doctrine on a whole range of issues as a Catholic, even though, as you know, Aquinas argued about, in Summa Theologica, about human life and being, when it occurs,” Biden said. \nPlanned Parenthood called the vice president a \"champion of women's health in America\" in a statement released on Wednesday. \n\"Questions about when life begins are personal -- for some it's based on faith, for others it's a matter of science or medicine,\" Planned Parenthood vice president of communications Eric Ferraro said. \"Vice President Biden understands that politicians aren't the experts. He understands that Americans support a woman's access to safe and legal abortion, and he legislates based on the needs of the people he represents.\" \nBiden’s comments come as Pope Francis visits Washington, and as the prospect for a government shutdown has increased because of conservative demands that a funding bill not include money for Planned Parenthood because of abortion. \nWhile Biden has yet to decide whether to run for the White House, a poll released by Bloomberg Politics showed him trialing front-runner Hillary Clinton by just 8 points and besting Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by 1 point. \n-Updated 3:43 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:50:24.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
