He described Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as a tyrant. \n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Louis Charbonneau, writing by Michelle Nichols)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:15:21.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
