Ron Wyden (Ore.), Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Bob Menendez (N.J.), Tom Carper (Del.), Ben Cardin (Md.), Michael Bennet (Colo.), Bob Casey, Jr. (Pa.) and Mark Warner (Va.) signed the letter.\nThe administration is pushing new requirements for financial advisers to disclose how they receive payments from financial institutions off selling investment advice to consumers. \nThe business community, Republicans and an increasing number of Democrats argue that proposal is unworkable and needs significant changes. \nThey say the proposal would force Americans into using automated financial services and significantly increase the costs of using human financial advisers because of the new regulatory hurdles. \nWyden's letter comes following letters last week from Democratic Sens. Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.) also criticizing the rule. \nTogether, 12 centrist Democrats in the upper chamber have publicly criticized the proposal, which also failed to gain traction in 2010. \nThat opposition increases Republicans' chances of being able to stall administration officials from implementing the rule through legislative action. \nWith 12 Democrats on board, Republicans would likely be able to clear the 60-vote procedural hurdle to advance legislation blocking the rules in the fall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:00:44.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
