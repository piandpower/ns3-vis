Day 2: Obama to talk ISIS, meet with Castro By Ashley Fantz , CNN Updated 1518 GMT (2218 HKT) September 29, 2015 The United Nations General Assembly is expected to discuss ISIS and the Syrian refugee crisis on Tuesday. Story highlights Obama will chair session focused on foreign fighters and ISIS Obama will later meet on the sidelines with Cuba's Raul Castro Biden will meet with Afghanistan's leader while Afghan forces try to retake Kunduz from Taliban (CNN) Will there be more icy toasts? More stiff and uncomfortable handshakes? More impassioned speeches? The 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York devoted its first day Monday largely to heads of state giving speeches that focused on the war in Syria and one of its tragic results, the largest refugee crisis since World War II. The speeches leaders gave were rich in passion and substance, despite all the attention by the end of the day on frosty interactions between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Expect more discussion and globally influential hobnobbing Tuesday. Here are a few highlights to get you started. • Obama will chair a summit focused on how to counter the ISIS terror group and reduce extremism worldwide. Obama convened a similar session last year about how to reduce the number of foreign fighters who were joining ISIS. The flow of people from Europe, Africa, the United States and elsewhere continued unabated. This year will be different, officials say, because there will be a concentration on \"life stages\" of a terrorist, homing in on the ideologies that can foster extremism at a young age. Obama wants to check in with partner nations to see how they have implemented changes decided on last year and push them to do more. • Later Tuesday morning, Obama is expected to meet on the sidelines with Cuban President Raul Castro. It's their second meeting since the U.S. and Cuba's renewed diplomatic ties. The pair are expected to brainstorm economic plans including an agreement to allow commercial flights to travel between the countries.
