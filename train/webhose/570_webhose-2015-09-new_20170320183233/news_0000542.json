Trump has so far resisted subject-specific set speeches preferring a freewheeling style where he bounces from topic to topic. So far in the 2016 race, he's typically hit on his will to eradicate the threat posed by Islamic militants, distaste for the White House's pending Iran nuclear deal and his belief that China and Mexico are browbeating the United States in trade negotiations. But Trump's speech -- billed as national security-focused -- comes one day before he is expected to be on the defensive Wednesday at CNN's debate. Several rival GOP candidates have said they plan to take aim at the real estate mogul, to press him on policy specifics. Trump has recently struggled with some basic foreign policy questions, most prominently in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt -- who will be one of the questioners at the CNN debate at the Reagan Library. Speaking to Hewitt on Sept. 3, Trump said that the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah, the groups that pose the most direct threat to Israel, does not yet matter to him. \"It will when it's appropriate,\" Trump responded. Trump was also flustered early in the interview when he appeared not to know the name of General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Forces who has played a critical role in Iraq and in the fight against ISIS. He is also believed to be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. troops in Iraq. Trump initially thought Hewitt said \"Kurds\" and not \"Quds\" and began saying that the Kurds, who have been crucial allies in the fight against ISIS, \"have been horribly mistreated.\" CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> Race to the White House More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:30:22.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
