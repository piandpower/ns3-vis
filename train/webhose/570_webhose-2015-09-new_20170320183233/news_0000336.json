And I'm not going to anticipate failure now because I think we have the better argument.\"\nHe pitched the deal as one that could potentially lead to increased cooperation among countries that are typically rivals, and pointed to the Islamic State's rise as one threat that could unite the region.\n\"I do think that it is even conceivable that Saudi Arabia and Iran, at some point, would begin to recognize that their enemy is chaos as much as anything else,\" Obama said. \"And what ISIL represents and what the collapse of Syria or Yemen or others represent is far more dangerous than whatever rivalries that may exist between those two nation states.\"\nRELATED: Obama: 'You don't negotiate deals with your friends'\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-08-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T19:39:15.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
