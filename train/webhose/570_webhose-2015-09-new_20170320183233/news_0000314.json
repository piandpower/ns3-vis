MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images \nAsked if Obama would consider taking executive action to close the prison if Congress blocks him, Earnest said, \"The president and his team are always considering a wide array of options. \n\"But the fact is the best way for us to do this is for members of Congress of both parties to work effectively with the administration,\" Earnest said. \nClosing the prison is likely to involve transferring some detainees to prisons within the United States. Republicans have barred those transfers and already have begun to push back against suggestions floated by the administration as possible host sites. \nDefense Secretary Ash Carter said on Aug. 20 that a U.S. army delegation had visited a potential facility in Leavenworth, Kansas, and would soon tour the U.S. Naval Consolidated Brig at Charleston, South Carolina. \nIn response, Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley said at a news conference, \"We are not going to allow any terrorists\" to be housed in Charleston.
