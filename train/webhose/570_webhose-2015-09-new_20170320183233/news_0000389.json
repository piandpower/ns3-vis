Paul Brandeis Raushenbush Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington Post Posted: 09/04/2015 04:49 PM EDT \nAbortion is back in the headlines with stepped up attacks on Planned Parenthood and Pope Francis giving all priests the power to forgive what the Catholic Church deems a \"grave sin.\" Abortion is a contentious and complicated issue that involves science as well as personal ethics and, to some, theology. \nOn this week’s All Together podcast, host Paul Raushenbush talks with two guests: Dr. Candida Moss, who weighs in on why the Pope is addressing abortion now, just weeks before he arrives in the United States and what his message really means for Catholic women; and Dr. Joel Hoffman, who recently wrote a piece on abortion and the Bible and what we can, and cannot, learn from scripture. \nDr. Candida Moss who is a Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at Notre Dame. Her New book, co-written with Joel Baden, is called Reconceiving Infertility: Biblical Perspectives on Procreation and Childlessness \nDr. Joel M. Hoffman holds a PhD in theoretical linguistics, has taught Bible in religious settings and translation theory at Brandeis University.
