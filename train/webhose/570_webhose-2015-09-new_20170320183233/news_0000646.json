Barack Obama of ducking debates and avoiding tough questions. \nCalling out Obama for refusing to agree to a debate in Wisconsin, a 2008 Clinton ad stated that \"maybe he prefers to give speeches than to have to answer questions.\" \nEd Henry noted on \"The Real Story\" today that O'Malley attacked DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz for limiting the debate schedule to just four before the Iowa caucuses and only six overall. \nO'Malley accuses the DNC of protecting Clinton, even calling the process \"rigged\" in favor of the frontrunning former First Lady. He's calling on supporters to protest outside the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s D.C. headquarters. \nHenry pointed out that AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka appeared to say nicer things about Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who is not in the race, than about Clinton in terms of their support for workers. Trumka also agreed yesterday that there should be more debates on the Democratic side. \nThe party held more than two dozen debates in 2008. \nWatch the 2008 footage in Henry's report above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T01:57:19.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
