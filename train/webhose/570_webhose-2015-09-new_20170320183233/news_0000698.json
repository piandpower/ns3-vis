Steinle was shot in the back as she walked with her father along the waterfront. \nLopez-Sanchez, a 45-year-old Mexican national, acknowledged shooting Steinle but said the gun he claimed to have found fired accidentally. \nThe shooting triggered a national debate over immigration after it was revealed that the Sheriff's Department had released Lopez-Sanchez despite a federal request to detain him for possible deportation. \nLopez-Sanchez was previously deported five times. \nSan Francisco and other cities and counties across the state have enacted sanctuary policies of ignoring so-called detainer requests.
