ADVERTISEMENT “Politicians of both sides talk about it, but nobody does anything about it,” the former Hewlett-Packard CEO added. “We have talked about it for every election for 25 years.”\nShe blamed government “ineptitude” for the nation’s border security struggles, the newspaper reported. \nFiorina is surging in the polls following a widely hailed performance during last week’s Republican presidential debate, during which she sparred several times with Trump. \nShe is trying to capitalize on the debate momentum with a three-day visit to South Carolina, a crucial early-voting state that has been a focus for many of the Republican contenders. \nDuring her stop at The Citadel, Fiorina said she opposes President Obama’s push to close the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \n“I don’t think you fix things that aren’t broken,” Fiorina said. “I don’t think Gitmo is broken, [so we should] keep it open.” \nThe Associated Press , meanwhile, reported Tuesday that the businesswoman said she favors a tougher stance with China’s leadership. \n“What happens if you let your teenager do bad stuff over and over again, what do they do? Bad stuff,” Fiorina said, according to AP. \n“Well, it’s true of China and [others],” added Fiorina, also noting Iran's and Russia’s actions abroad. \nFiorina also said she would cancel Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit this week in retaliation for hacking attacks on the United States. \nShe would instead meet Xi privately while using “economic leverage, retribution and consequences” for any antagonistic actions by Beijing. \n“The Chinese government is struggling. … The stock market is in free-fall,” she said. “They are dependent on this market continuing to be open to them.” \nFiorina ranks sixth out of 15 candidates, with 6.3 percent support, in the latest RealClearPolitics average of samplings . \nTrump, meanwhile, leads the race for the Republican presidential nomination, with 28.5 percent support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T03:21:53.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
