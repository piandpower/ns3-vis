Posted: 09/19/2015 06:57 PM EDT \nDES MOINES, Iowa -- Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) declined to say on Saturday whether or not he believes that President Barack Obama is Christian. \nAsked simply whether or not he believed the president was Christian, Cruz, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president, said that he didn't want to speculate. \n\"The president's faith is between him and God. I'm not going to speculate on the president's faith. What I will talk about is his policies. And his policies have been profoundly damaging to this country,\" he said. \"His policies and this administration's animosity to religious liberty and, in fact, antagonism to Christians has been one of the most troubling aspects of the Obama administration.\" \nCruz's comments came after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump declined to correct a man who said at a rally that Obama was Muslim. The incident drew quick condemnation from the White House , Democrats and some Republicans . \nObama, who is definitely Christian, in April made fun of people who somehow still think he is Muslim . \nWatch Cruz's comments in the video above. \nSamantha-Jo Roth contributed reporting from Des Moines and Sam Levine contributed from Washington. \nAlso on HuffPost: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T02:02:18.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
