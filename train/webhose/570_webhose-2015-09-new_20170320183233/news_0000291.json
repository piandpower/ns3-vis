Posted: 09/24/2015 11:29 AM EDT | Edited: 25 minutes ago ASSOCIATED PRESS \nWASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week while both men are in New York for the United Nations General Assembly at Putin's request, a senior Obama administration official said on Thursday. \n\"Given the situations in Ukraine and Syria, despite our profound differences with Moscow, the president believes that it would be irresponsible not to test whether we can make progress through high-level engagement with the Russians,\" the U.S. official said. \n\"President Obama will take advantage of this meeting to discuss Ukraine, and he will be focused on ensuring Moscow lives up to the Minsk commitments. This will be the core message of this bilateral engagement.\" (Reporting by Jeff Mason and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Eric Walsh) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:59:42.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
