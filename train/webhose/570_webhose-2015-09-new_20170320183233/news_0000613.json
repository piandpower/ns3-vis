I'm talking about you and me. We're not terrorists. None of us has a sneaky nuclear weapons program in our basement. Nor are we threatening to wipe Israel off the map.\nYou and I are honest, just good hard-working citizens wanting to do the right thing. So, tell me, why is President Obama hiding from us the full Iran nuclear deal with all its possible side deals? The Iran deal might be the most important deal in yours and my lifetime, and yet we don't know what is in it. None of us does. We can't read it because our government won't show it to us.\nInstead, our politicians, including the president, pat us on the head and say, \"Trust us.\" I'm so over that. I don't trust anyone. I want to see it myself.\nSo, the deal should be put online on Whitehouse.gov. Transparency - remember that word? And don't tell me the deal is classified. President Obama can un-classify it. He is the president.\nAnd don't tell me we need to keep it secret from the enemy. The enemy knows all about it. They helped us write it. It's not a secret from Iran. It's only a secret from us, American citizens. Ayatollah Khomeini and President -- they know every page of the deal. You and I are in the dark.\nYou know that's wrong. This is so messed up. And that's my \"Off the Record\" comment.\non-the-record On the Record , hosted by Greta Van Susteren, airs on Weekdays at 7PM ET on Fox News Channel.\nMore on this show", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:33:12.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
