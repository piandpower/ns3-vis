And it's not just you, but your family and the sacrifices. So thank you very much for your service.\" Krzyzewski is the same man who criticized the administration's strategy regarding ISIS and said in 2009 when Mr. Obama didn't choose Duke for the Final Four, \"The economy is something he should focus on, probably more than the brackets.\" Obama is a major basketball fan -- known to often play and closely follow details of the game and teams. In fact, he knew the various summer activities of the Duke players and asked them about them before the event, according to Krzyzewski, who told reporters he was surprised the President knew some of the details.
