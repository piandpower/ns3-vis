Mollie Reilly Deputy Politics Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 09/23/2015 01:06 PM EDT ASSOCIATED PRESS \nPresident Barack Obama paid tribute to baseball legend Yogi Berra, praising the 3-time MVP and 10-time World Series champion as someone who \"epitomized what it meant to be a sportsman and a citizen.\" \n\"Yogi Berra was an American original – a Hall of Famer and humble veteran; prolific jokester and jovial prophet,\" Obama said in a statement released by the White House Wednesday. \"He epitomized what it meant to be a sportsman and a citizen, with a big heart, competitive spirit, and a selfless desire to open baseball to everyone, no matter their background. Michelle and I offer our deepest condolences to his family, his friends, and his fans in New York and across the world.\" \nBerra, who died Tuesday at the age of 90, played 18 seasons for the New York Yankees, and is widely recognized as one of the best catchers in the history of the game. He later managed both the Yankees and the New York Mets. \nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Republican 2016 hopeful Jeb Bush also mourned the iconic ballplayer: \"Baseball is 90% mental—the other half is physical.\" Yogi gave everything at least 140%. We'll miss him. My prayers are with his family. -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 23, 2015 When asked if he had an audience with Pope John XXIII, Yogi Berra replied \"No, but I met with him.” Am sure they’re meeting again today.
