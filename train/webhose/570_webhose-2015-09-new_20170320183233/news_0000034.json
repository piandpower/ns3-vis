Homosexuality is not a job qualification. The U.S. military is designed to keep Americans safe and complete combat missions, not conduct social experiments.\" Obama announced on Friday he was nominating Eric K. Fanning to lead the Army. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the first openly gay secretary of a U.S. military branch. Fanning has served as acting under secretary of the Army since June, and before that, served as chief of staff to Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. Fanning also served as under secretary of the Air Force and deputy undersecretary of the Navy. An inquiry from CNN asking the Huckabee campaign to comment on Fanning's qualifications was not immediately returned. A request for comment from the White House also was not immediately returned. Fanning's nomination is one of many steps the Obama administration has taken to advance the rights of the LGBT community in the armed forces. In 2010, the President signed a law ending the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy that prohibited gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military, and earlier this year, the President moved to allow those who identify as transgender to openly serve as well. \"Eric brings many years of proven experience and exceptional leadership to this new role,\" the President said in a statement Friday. \"I am grateful for his commitment to our men and women in uniform, and I am confident he will help lead America's Soldiers with distinction.\" CNN's Allie Malloy contributed to this report.
