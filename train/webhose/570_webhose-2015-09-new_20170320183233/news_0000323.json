Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters he expects Obama and Netanyahu to meet \"sometime in early November,” but that a final date has not been set. ADVERTISEMENT The meeting would mark the leaders’ first face-to-face encounter since the July finalization of the Iran nuclear deal — an accord Netanyahu has fiercely criticized. The president spoke to Netanyahu by phone after the deal was reached and after the prime minister won reelection in March. Obama and Netanyahu have had a rocky relationship since both took office in 2009, but it reached a nadir in March when the Israeli leader blasted the Iran nuclear agreement in a speech to Congress. The speech angered the White House, especially since Netanyahu’s government reportedly declined to inform the administration of its plans before it accepted an invitation from House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Obama and Netanyahu have also clashed over the prime minister’s pre-election declaration that he would not back the creation of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu later walked back his comments. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T20:39:06.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
