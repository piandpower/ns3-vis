The Iranian side said the historic handshake had \"not been pre-planned\" and took part on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly according to a source in the delegation quoted in the IRNA semi-official news agency. A senior Obama administration official told CNN the two men shook hands but also said that a rumored grip-and-greet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did not take place.
