An unarmed robbery charge was dropped.\nPolice say Suarez was pursuing a marijuana deal in July when he showed up at a home in Lenawee County's Raisin Township. But instead of carrying pot, he had a backpack stuffed with dirty socks.\nPolice say a purse with $2,800 was stolen from the home. Suarez and others were stopped after speeding through a stop sign.\nDefense attorney John Glaser says the \"false pretenses\" were the dirty socks. Suarez will be eligible for parole after a year in prison. His maximum sentence is 7 &frac12; years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T05:19:40.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
