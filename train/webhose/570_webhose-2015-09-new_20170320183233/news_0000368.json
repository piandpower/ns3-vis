Decker.\nProsecutors indicted 65-year-old Jason Shiao, also known as “Jason Zheng” and his daughter Lynn Leung, 43, on charges of immigration fraud. They face five years in prison if convicted.\nPosing as immigration lawyers, the father-daughter team placed ads in Chinese language newspapers. For a $50,000 fee, the Pasadena pair promised to obtain a visa and lawful status for Chinese nationals through marriages with U.S. citizens, according to a search warrant affidavit filed in the case by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n“Hollywood may portray marriage fraud as a romantic farce, but it’s a serious crime with serious implications,” said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge for ICE investigations in Los Angeles. “Schemes like this not only undermine the integrity of our nation’s legal immigration system, they pose a security vulnerability and potentially rob deserving immigrants of benefits they rightfully deserve.”\nArnold says the \"couples\" went to elaborate measures to fake their marriage, including trips to New Zealand and Las Vegas for honeymoon photos. Additional photos were taken at bridal shops, churches and wedding photos in nearby parks to support the ruse.\nThe photos, along with phony bank statements, utility bills and rental agreements, were then shown to officials during their immigration interview.\nOfficials say the father and daughter team arranged 70 fake weddings over the last decade for over $3.5 million.\nAmericans willing to participate in the fraud were promised $10,000, but often did not receive the full amount. Investigators received a tip from an anonymous source three years ago regarding the alleged visa scam.\nShiao and his daughter carry dual passports from China and Australia.\nSo far, 23 U.S. citizens admitted to being a part of the scheme. Court records suggest in no case did the couples live together or consummate their marriage.\n\nWilliam La Jeunesse joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in March 1998 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based national correspondent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:00:34.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
