However, the Fiorina camp circulated a video of a kicking fetus, which was included in the ad put out by CARLY for America. \nIn the opening of the video, the text says that “Carly won the debate, so here come the false attacks.” It then shows a number of commentators and news outlets criticizing Fiorina over her remarks.\nWARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO \n\nThe video goes on to show the scene to which Fiorina was referring -- a fetus with its legs kicking -- before showing another clip of an aborted fetus, and then a former Planned Parenthood technician describing how she was told: “We're going to procure brain.”\nThe video finishes by quoting Fiorina again: “This is about the character of our nation.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T00:41:12.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
