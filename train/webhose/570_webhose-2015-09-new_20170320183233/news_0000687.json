Wearing a pair of orange gloves, Obama examined some of the fish that he caught. The second one he picked up began squirting at his shoes. \"Uh-oh, what's happening there?\" he asked. The woman standing by him explained that the salmon was spawning. \"Did you see that? Something got on my shoes,\" Obama called to the press. \"He was spawning a little bit, which, generally you don't want fish spawning on your feet.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> Politics Originals The Navy SEAL running for Congress, who happens to be transgender By S.E.
