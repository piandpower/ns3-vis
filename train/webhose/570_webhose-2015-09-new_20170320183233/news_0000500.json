I assure you that President Obama will be just as direct when he sees President Xi. This is a vital relationship of the 21st century, and we have to be up front about our differences, because they are preventing us from reaching the full potential of our cooperation,\" said Rice during a speech at George Washington University about the meeting the two leaders will hold at the White House on Friday.\nXi on Tuesday begins his first state visit to the United States, with stops in Seattle, Washington and New York.\nOn Thursday, Obama and Xi will have a private dinner at the White House and the next day, after a meeting in the Oval Office and a joint press conference, the U.S. president will honor his guest with a state dinner.\nXi's visit to Washington comes at a time of particular bilateral tension over mutual accusations of cyber-spying and U.S. concerns over what it views as unwarranted expansion by Beijing by building artificial islands in the South China Sea, one of the world busiest shipping zones.\nRice noted on Monday that Obama had made clear to China on several occasions that economic cyber-espionage \"must stop\" and that it does not constitute merely a \"mild irritation\" for the United States, but rather it is something that places \"enormous strain\" on the bilateral relationship.\nLast week, Obama said that his government is preparing a series of measures to pressure China to stop cyber-spying and stealing trade secrets.\nRegarding tensions in the South China Sea, Rice said Monday that the United States \"takes no position on competing territorial claims,\" however Washington insists on and will continue to emphasize its \"fundamental national interest in preserving freedom of navigation and commerce through some of the world's busiest sea lanes. The United States of America will sail, fly, and operate anywhere that international law permits.\"\nHowever, Rice went on to emphasize that the bilateral relationship between Washington and Beijing \"is too big and too important to treat with anything less than our full, good-faith effort,\" although \"the real points of friction between us cannot be papered over, and we will continue to deal forthrightly with our differences,\" Rice said.\n\"When China and the United States work together, the world is more secure and more prosperous,\" she added.
