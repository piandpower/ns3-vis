It's not enough to simply issue a written statement. That's just an after thought.\nSo last night, right here, I called out both President Obama and Attorney General Loretta Lynch for not making on-camera strong public condemnations for what is happening to law enforcement in this country. I used the word \"condemnation\" because it requires condemnation.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nVAN SUSTEREN: Their statements need to be on camera, a full-throated condemnation of this violence on police.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nNow, I'm not going to take credit. But good for Attorney General Loretta Lynch, because this morning she did make a strong public statement of support on camera, even using the word I suggested last night, \"condemn.\"\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nLORETTA LYNCH, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: I want to take just a few minutes and talk about some of the recent tragic events in some of our communities involving police shootings which affect us all. I strongly condemn these recent and brutal police shootings in Texas and in Illinois. We have had four more guardians slain and, frankly, our hearts are broken over this. I offered the families of these officers my condolences and I ask that all of us come together and keep them in our prayers.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSo thank you to the attorney general. It means a great deal to law enforcement. Now we await the president. Mr. President, it's your turn.\non-the-record On the Record , hosted by Greta Van Susteren, airs on Weekdays at 7PM ET on Fox News Channel.\nMore on this show", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:18:35.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
