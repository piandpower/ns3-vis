Dylan Richard, the campaign’s director of engineering, is the firm's chief technology officer. Based in Chicago, the company was in development for a few years before publicly launching. \nReed told news outlets that he made the deal to expand the company, since PayPal is already an industry leader. \nIn a blog post , PayPal noted that the newly acquired company will increase PayPal’s foothold in a new payment model that allows customers to buy products on multiple platforms “at the moment of discovery” — something described as “contextual commerce.” \n“Modest allows merchants to offer an end-to-end experience that makes selling on any platform easier and simpler. They have built exceptional mobile technology and bring deep talent in contextual commerce to PayPal,” said Bill Ready, a senior vice president with PayPal. \nThe terms of the deal were not disclosed. Modest will become a part of Braintree, an online payment company that was acquired by PayPal in 2013. Braintree is also based in Chicago.
