ADVERTISEMENT “Unless we can have full access, 24/7, anytime, any day, there's nothing to negotiate,\" said Carson, according to the Des Moines Register .\nCarson spoke while making a campaign stop at the Des Moines Farmers Market, as he works to line up support ahead of that state’s critical first-in-the-nation caucuses. \nCarson’s visit was mainly a meet-and-greet and light on a policy message. \nBut the Iowans that did get a chance to chat up Carson came away with positive impressions. \n\"I love him. He's fantastic. He's refreshing,\" said Norbert Juist. \"He's not an establishment candidate.\" \nAs for Carson, he played it safe when asked about his favorite food at the market. \n“They're all my favorite,\" Carson said. \"How's that for a political answer?\" Tags: Past: 1 day Bush at Urban League: Obama was '...
