Many bishops have granted priests permission to forgive the sin. The fact that this statement is coming from the Pope and in such a moving, pastoral way, is more evidence of the great pastoral approach and concern of Pope Francis.\n\"That people come to confession today to confess abortion and other grave sins is cause for us in the Church to thank God and to put into practice the mission of the good and merciful shepherd who came to seek out those who were lost.\"\nAugust: Pope says Church should embrace divorced people\nMany women 'believe that they have no other option'\n\"I am well aware of the pressure that has led them to this decision,\" the Pope said of women who've had an abortion, in a letter published Tuesday by the Vatican.\nMany women, the Pope said, \"believe that they have no other option.\"\n8 photos: The quotable Pope: Some of his
