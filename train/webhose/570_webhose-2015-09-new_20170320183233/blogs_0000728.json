Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) chided President Obama as a “weak opponent of evil and a poor champion of freedom” for his support of the Iran nuclear deal during a Saturday morning speech. \n“If you want a nuclear power program for peaceful purposes, you can have it,” Graham said of Iranian Ayatollah Khamenei during the Values Voter Summit in Washington, an event for conservative Christians. ADVERTISEMENT “But you’re not going to have the ability to make a bomb because I think you’re a religious Nazi and you would destroy Israel and come after us. If a man threatens to cut your throat, don’t buy him a knife.”\nGraham hit familiar topics from his stump speech during the event, sharing his personal story of how the death of his parents at a young age forced him to take care of his sister. A foreign policy hawk, he also spent much of the address laying out the need for a stronger military and scolding Democrats on defense policy. \nHe also extolled his commitment to anti-abortion measures to the crowd of religious conservative voters. Graham is the sponsor of a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks, a bill that failed to advance on a procedural vote in the Senate last week.. \n“We’re one of seven countries that allow abortion on demand at 20 weeks, the fifth month in the pregnancy. Does that make us a better people?” he asked the crowd, who responded with a, “No.” \n“I’m trying to get us out of that club. Fifty-four votes, short of what we need but we will eventually get there because we’re not going to quit,” he added. \nDespite his long tenure in the Senate, Graham consistently finishes towards the bottom of GOP presidential polling and is not seen as one of the contenders to win the summit’s presidential straw poll.
