Chris Christie said Thursday Carly Fiorina talked too much last night about herself and not enough about the issues. Christie also criticized the former Hewlett-Packard executive for interrupting him. \"She's got one place on the stage, not two or three,\" he said on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"I'm happy to sit and listen to her but don't interrupt me and don't interrupt the other candidates.\" From the moment he took the stage, Christie tried to emphasize the idea that he was focused more on voters than himself. \"I'd like you to take the camera off me and put it on the audience,\" Christie said as he launched into the opening statement on Wednesday. 15 photos: Republican debates: The main event 15 photos: Republican debates: The main event Republican presidential candidates stand on stage before the main debate Wednesday, September 16, at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.
