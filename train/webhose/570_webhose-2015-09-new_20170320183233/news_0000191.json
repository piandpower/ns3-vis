ADVERTISEMENT She extended an invitation for Sharif to visit Washington, the White House added, “to further strengthen the U.S.-Pakistani relationship.”\nThe U.S. and Pakistan have long been held together by practical concerns for mutual security, though the connection has been frayed by mutual mistrust. \nDuring her visit this weekend, Rice met with Sharif as well as his national security and foreign policy advisor Sartaj Aziz, Chief of Army Staff Gen. Raheel Sharif and other officials, the White House said. \n“They discussed how the United States and Pakistan can continue to work together on a range of regional and global issues,” the White House added. \nPakistani officials, meanwhile, warned Rice about the U.S.’s possible suspension of $300 million in support money meant to reimburse Pakistan for its efforts to combat regional violence that destabilizes neighboring Afghanistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn . \nThe next tranche of support money is contingent on the Pentagon’s certification that Pakistan has disrupted an insurgent group known as the Haqqani network in the mountainous North Waziristan part of the country, which lies on the Afghan border. The Defense Department has yet to make that certification. \nThe Haqqani network is an ally of the Taliban and was described in 2011 by then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen as being “a veritable arm” of Pakistan’s military intelligence.
