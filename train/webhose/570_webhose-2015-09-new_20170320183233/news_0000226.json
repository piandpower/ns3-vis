Jews typically observe the holiday by fasting and praying for atonement for sins. This year, the holiday coincides with Pope Francis’s visit to Washington, D.C. Obama is expected to greet Francis upon his arrival at Joint Base Andrews just hours before the holiday begins at sundown. The timing has complicated matters for Jewish lawmakers and politicos wishing to attend welcome festivities at the White House on Wednesday and his speech to a joint session of Congress on Thursday. Asked about the conflict last week, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the White House pushed the Vatican to ensure Jewish community members could participate in other “important interfaith efforts” during the pope’s visit. “We were very mindful — as was the Vatican — in ensuring that that would be the case, knowing that his time here was going to overlap with Yom Kippur,” Rhodes said. In his statement, Obama called the holiday for people of all faiths to find common values. “On this special day, may our common humanity unite us, and may our common faith in a better future inspire us to continue healing our world,” he said.
