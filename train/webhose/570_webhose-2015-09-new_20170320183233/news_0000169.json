Before that, he was special assistant to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and was undersecretary of the Air Force. \n\"Eric brings many years of proven experience and exceptional leadership to this new role,\" Obama said in a statement. \"I am grateful for his commitment to our men and women in uniform, and I am confident he will help lead America's Soldiers with distinction. I look forward to working with Eric to keep our Army the very best in the world.\" \nFanning's nomination marks the latest step the administration has taken to open up the military to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Obama ended the \"don't ask, don't tell\" ban on gay and lesbian troops in 2011, and Carter is currently reviewing how to best lift the ban on transgender troops . \nFanning still has to be confirmed by the Senate.
