The Texas team features blondes and the Mexican team brunettes. Do you think the ad is stereotyping? \nDel Toro: I’m actually born and raised in Texas and (on) Team Mexico. I’m a brunette, but I was born and raised in Texas. I think they really just wanted to differentiate, you know, this team as Hispanic and this team as American, and I guess that was an easier way to do it. So, you weren’t confused. \nFOX411: How did you get the commercial? \nDel Toro: Yeah, I missed the casting. I was home visiting my family and my agent sent them a video of me and had me come directly to the callback. I had no idea we were going to play volleyball so I showed up in my dress and high heels to a volleyball court, and I had to take off my shoes, go barefoot. I had a bikini in my car and I auditioned and somehow they booked me. I’m horrible at volleyball, but luckily that didn’t matter that much. \nFOX411: What’s next for you? Is there any model’s career you want to emulate? Has anyone dubbed you the next so and so? \nDel Toro: This industry is so unpredictable. I had no idea I was even up for a Carl’s Jr. commercial three days before I got it, so who knows. I have a Beach Bunny campaign coming out and a few other projects I’m working on, so we’ll have to see; hopefully all good things. I don’t know if I’ve been dubbed the next anyone really. I love Kate Upton. I love healthy, curvy models. Good businesswomen. \nDiana Falzone is a FoxNews.com reporter. You can follow her on Twitter @dianafalzone.
