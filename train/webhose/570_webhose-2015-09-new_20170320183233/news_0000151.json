Earlier this week, protesters in the city turned away buses carrying about 140 immigrants that had been apprehended in Texas and flown to California for processing as Texas deals with an influx of immigrants. Federal officials estimate more than 50,000 minors, mostly from Central America, have been caught crossing the border since October 2013.

It was invalidated by federal courts, but not before it helped drive Latinos away from the Republican Party. \nLast month, Trump, who's leading many polls, outlined proposals to deny citizenship to U.S.-born babies of immigrants living in the United States illegally as part of an immigration plan. Emphasizing border security and millions of deportations, he also says he would build a wall along the U.S. southern border and force Mexico to pay for it. \nThose proposals, and his comments suggesting that Mexicans coming across the border are largely \"criminals and rapists,\" have angered a population group national Republicans see as critical to the party's success. \nLike us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:30:48.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
