Obama was walking through the neighborhood of Treme, a historic, predominantly black area that experienced significant flooding because of the storm. He was in town to mark the anniversary of Katrina and highlight the area's resilience and growth. As he was visiting with residents of the neighborhood, Obama met a woman who called herself \"Wheezy.\" Obama asked if it was \"Wheezy\" as in the classic sitcom \"Sanford and Sons,\" though the small crowd corrected him that it was a character on \"The Jeffersons,\" instead. Obama then sang a few bars of the seminal show's theme song, \"Movin' on Up,\" laughing with the woman. The President is no stranger to bursting into song. He sang an emotionally-charged rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" at his eulogy for the victims of the church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and more light-heartedly showed off his Al Green impersonation at a fundraiser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T04:02:28.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
