Roy Bordamonte, started talking to them inaudibly. When they said they couldn’t hear and asked the police officer to get out of his car, he got angry and cursed at them and threatened to call immigration authorities on them. \nThe couple recorded the incident. \nIn the recorded encounter, the officer asked Vidal's boyfriend, \"You go to school? What are you, [expletive] special ed? You [expletive] an idiot. You might be an idiot because you mouthed off. That's why you're going to get this ticket.\" \nThen he added: \"Don't worry, I'm going to knock on your [expletive] door, and I'm going to check your mom's ID, and all your [expletive] cousins and relatives, and when they give me a fake [expletive] name, I'm going to have immigration pick everybody up so they can go back to the [expletive] border or wherever the [expletive] they came from. And all the hard work they came to America, you [expletive] it up.” \n\"I don't see you smiling. Where's that smile now?\" the officer says, before taunting him: \"Let's go, bro. You were talking all this [expletive], bro.\" \nPassaic Mayor Alex Blanco told NBC’s New York affiliate that the city is investigating the incident. \nIt remains unclear what prompted the police officer to begin speaking to the couple. \nLike us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:29:34.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
