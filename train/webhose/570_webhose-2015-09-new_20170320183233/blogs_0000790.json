A teacher questioned whether the clock was a bomb and confiscated it. \nThe student was later handcuffed and taken into police headquarters for questioning, according to NBC Dallas-Fort Worth . \nReports emerged on Tuesday that Mohammed is an avid tinkerer who also builds his own radios and repairs go-karts. His family argues the incident is a result of anti-Muslim sentiment in Irving’s schools and law enforcement agencies. \n“He just wants to invent good things for mankind,” said the boy’s father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, a Sudanese immigrant. \n“But because his name is Mohammed and because of Sept. 11, I think my son got mistreated,” he added, citing the 14 th anniversary last weekend of the terrorist attacks. \nAhmed Mohamed’s suspension is drawing outrage on social media via the hashtag #StandwithAhmed. \nDemocrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign tweeted its solidarity with the Texas student on Wednesday morning. \n“Assumptions and fears don’t keep us safe – they hold us back,” they wrote . “Ahmed, stay curious and keep building.” \nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) also expressed support for the teenager. \n“Keep making #IStandWithAhmed,” he tweeted . “The world needs creative, innovative & brave people like you.” \nThe Dallas Morning News reported that Ahmed Mohamed remains suspended and has vowed to never build mechanical devices again. \n— This story was updated at 1:38 p.m. Past: 1 day Obama invites suspended Muslim... “Cool clock, Ahmed,” Obama tweeted. “Want to bring it to the White House?” Sanders goes on the attack against...
