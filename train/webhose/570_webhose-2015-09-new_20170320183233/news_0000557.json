Obama said he hoped that the food was \"something that doesn't still have its legs and eyes on it. I want it not to be too recognizable.\" \nGrylls said he thought that Obama was a little taken aback when he took the half-eaten fish out of his backpack. \n\"I think the president looked a little surprised when I pulled out the bloody carcass of half-eaten salmon,\" Grylls said. \nBut after Grylls cooked the fish and Obama ate it, the president played it up like it was no big deal. \n\"That's tasty,\" said Obama, who also noted that he wished he would have had a cracker to go with the salmon. \"Bear is a mediocre cook but the fact that we ate something recognizable, was encouraging. Now, the fact that he told me this was a leftover fish from a bear, I don't know if that was necessary. He could've just left that out.\" \nObama's full appearance on the show will air on NBC later this year. \n﻿Watch the full clip above. \n﻿ Also on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:21:11.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
