Just 5 percent of respondents said they had engaged in extreme binge drinking â€” defined by the researchers as having had 15 or more drinks in a row at least once in the previous two weeks.\nThe number of students reporting they had used cocaine in the previous year increased from 2.7 percent in 2013 to 4.4 percent in 2014. Johnston called the increase statistically significant, but said it was too soon to know if the drug was actually making a comeback on college campuses.\nParents sending their children to college this fall can take comfort in another of the survey's findings, Johnston said: Half of the survey respondents said they had not used any illicit drugs in the past year.", "external_links": ["http://www.ap.org/"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:22:34.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
