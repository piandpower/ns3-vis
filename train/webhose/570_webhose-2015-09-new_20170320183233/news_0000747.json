Nina Bahadur Deputy Editor, HuffPost Women Posted: 09/21/2015 11:24 AM EDT | Edited: 09/21/2015 12:04 PM EDT \nWomen on Twitter are sharing their stories to help end the shame and stigma surrounding abortion. \nActivists Lindy West, Amelia Bonow and Kimberly Morrison started the #ShoutYourAbortion hashtag on Sept. 19, in response to the news that the House voted to defund Planned Parenthood . West asked people on Twitter to use the hashtag to share how their lives have been impacted by safe, legal abortion. My abortion was in '10 & the career I've built since then fulfills me & makes me better able to care for kids I have now. #ShoutYourAbortion — Lindy West (@thelindywest) September 20, 2015 \nWomen who have had abortions told their stories, and allies used the hashtag to show support for a woman's right to choose. Anti-abortion activists have attempted to co-opt the hashtag, showing just how common it is to shame and belittle women who have had abortions. The women who are using the hashtag to speak out in the face of insults, trolls and threats are a powerful reminder of how important these conversations are. \nSee more tweets from #ShoutYourAbortion below, and learn more about the hashtag here . Honestly, my abortion at 20 was one of the first responsible, non-self-destructive, grown-ass choices I ever made. #ShoutYourAbortion — Jessica Blankenship (@blanketboat) September 21, 2015 Ex partner of 4 yrs forced me into 2 abortions. My life is better now but only through the support of PP. #IStandWithPP #ShoutYourAbortion ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:01:23.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
