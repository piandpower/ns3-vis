It's called Muslims,\" said the unidentified man who spoke at a question-and-answer town hall event in Rochester, New Hampshire. \"You know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.\" A seemingly bewildered Trump interrupted the man, chuckling, \"We need this question? This is the first question?\" The man continued, asking Trump what he planned to do about \"training camps\" for people who want to kill Americans. Trump replied that he will be \"looking at that.\" But the real estate mogul declined to correct the questioner about his claims about Obama before moving on to another audience member. After the event, several reporters asked Trump why he didn't challenge the questioner's assertions. Trump did not answer. Obama, who has spoken openly about his Christian faith, was born to an American mother and Kenyan father in Hawaii. But Trump has been one of the leading skeptics of Obama's birthplace, saying he did not know where Obama was born as recently as July . A recent CNN/ORC poll found 29% of Americans believe Obama is a Muslim, including 43% of Republicans.
