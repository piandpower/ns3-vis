The current and former presidents hit the links at Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs, Mass. ADVERTISEMENT The pair were joined by U.S. Trade Representative Amb. Ron Kirk and Vernon Jordan, Clinton’s longtime political adviser. Saturday’s game precedes a birthday party for Jordan on Martha’s Vineyard later that evening. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is reportedly joining her husband Bill Clinton and the Obama family for the night’s festivities. Jordan’s birthday is the first encounter between Obama and his former secretary of State since she launched her Oval Office bid in April. It also follows Obama’s chance encounter with former President Bill Clinton a day earlier at the same golf course. The president was playing with NBA notables Stephen Curry, his father Dell Curry and Ray Allen during that round of golf. The Obamas are currently taking a two-week vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, a secluded Massachusetts island they often summer in. Obama is reportedly still working during his break by calling lawmakers and pressuring them for support of his nuclear deal with Iran.
