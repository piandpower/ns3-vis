But the truth is that (2012) was just the tip of the iceberg,\" Longoria told The Associated Press at the time. \"We are not tapping into the full potential yet of the Latino community.\" \nLike us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:21:51.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
