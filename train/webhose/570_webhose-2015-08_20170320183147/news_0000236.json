It also comes as Obama is pushing Congress to approve a deal with Iran -- Republicans, like Rubio, are united in their opposition to the deal, but have been seeking Democratic support.\nRELATED: Kerry to reopen embassy in Cuba, but tensions remain\nIf elected president, Rubio said he would begin the process of ending any Iran deal approved by the Obama administration.\n\"I will undertake a three-part plan to roll back President Obama's deal with Iran and repair the damage done to America's standing in the Middle East,\" Rubio said.\nIt is a move not quite as stark as others, like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who have said they would simply revoke the deal outright on their first day in office.\nRubio also said he would roll back the diplomatic deal struck to renew ties with Cuba.\n\"I will give the Castros a choice: either continue repressing your people and lose the diplomatic relations and benefits provided by President Obama, or carry out meaningful political and human rights reforms and receive increased U.S. trade, investment, and support,\" Rubio said.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:36:37.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
