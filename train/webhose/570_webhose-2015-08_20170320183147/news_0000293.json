It was taken October 31, 2012. And this is the important date. It was only six days before the November 2012 election. And many Republicans have been unhappy with Governor Christie for his greeting that day of President Obama, who then went on to trounce Governor Romney in the election.\nNow, after looking at the picture and the video, I concluded there was no hug. That was Governor Christie extending his hand to greet the president, and the president arrived in New Jersey to check out the damage just three days after Hurricane Sandy had slammed the state. I see a handshake.\nAnd the president putting his hand on Governor Christie's shoulder - no hug there. Of course, I'm trying very hard to be fair to Governor Christie and all the other candidates, so I show the photo and the video.\nAnd I add, I report, you decide. Take a look. Hug or no hug? I say no hug. Tell me what you think on my Facebook page. And by the way, there is no doubt a hug between Florida Governor Charlie Crist and President Obama. And that's my \"Off the Record\" comment tonight.\non-the-record On the Record , hosted by Greta Van Susteren, airs on Weekdays at 7PM ET on Fox News Channel.\nMore on this show", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T23:56:08.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
