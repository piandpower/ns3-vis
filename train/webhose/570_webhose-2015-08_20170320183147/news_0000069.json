He's spent the past few months explaining his position on the campaign trail, facing questions from voters who've heard about his view that falls largely outside of the conservative base.\nWhile he previously supported a path to citizenship, Bush now proposes going as far \"legal status\" only.\n\"That's where we land to get it done,\" Bush told reporters last week in Orlando, talking about immigration reform.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://medium.com/@JebBush/securing-the-border-and-enforcing-our-immigration-laws-fec3803b6821", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T18:26:56.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
