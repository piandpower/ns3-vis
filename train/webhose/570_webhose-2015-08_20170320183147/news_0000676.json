Ashley Alman Politics Social Media Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 08/26/2015 10:15 AM EDT | Edited: 2 minutes ago \nA young cancer survivor sent President Barack Obama a moving letter thanking him for keeping a promise made during a 2007 campaign stop -- a promise the boy says saved his life. \nGavin Nore, a teen from Fort Dodge, Iowa, told Obama in a letter shared by the White House Tuesday that he'd had the opportunity to meet the president during his first presidential campaign. At the time, Nore asked Obama whether he'd continue stem cell research during his presidency, to which the president responded he would. \nIn February 2013, Nore was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. He was 14 years old. Nore said he was \"cancer free\" by that summer, but was later re-diagnosed. \n\"I had to have a stem cell transplant. I beat the battle once again,\" Nore wrote to the president. \n\"I would like to thank you very much for continuing the research. If the research haden’t [sic] continued, I wouldn’t be here today.” \n“If the research hadn’t continued, I wouldn’t be here today.” —Gavin writing to President Obama about his battle with cancer.

Posted by The White House on Tuesday, August 25, 2015 \nThe White House launched a Tumblr account last week to share some of the letters the president has received during his time in office.
