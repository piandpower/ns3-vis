Individuals who refuse to leave at the time their visa expires should be subject to criminal penalties.” \nTrump’s strategy concludes that America’s immigration woes result in two threats — economic stagnation and undermined national security. \n“The influx of foreign workers holds down salaries, keeps unemployment high and makes it difficult for poor and working class Americans — including immigrants themselves and their children — to earn a middle class wage,” he said. \n“Additionally, we need to stop giving legal immigrant visas to people bent on causing us harm,” Trump added. “From the 9/11 hijackers, to the Boston Bombers and many others, our immigration system is being used to attack us.” \nThe GOP front-runner’s immigration remarks since entering the 2016 presidential race in June have sparked both international enthusiasm and outrage. \nThe release of Trump’s formal policy positions on Sunday follows criticism that his ideas on immigration are too vague.
