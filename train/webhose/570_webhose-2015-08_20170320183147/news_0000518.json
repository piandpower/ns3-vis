I guarantee you that's not how China, Germany and other countries around the world handle their infrastructure.” ADVERTISEMENT Obama, who has long pushed for a multi-year highway bill, said he had no choice but to sign the short-term measure to prevent an interruption of money for roads and bridges during the busy summer construction season. \nThe president also chided Congress for failing to renew the Export-Import Bank, which was left out of the highway bill against the White House’s wishes, and for making little progress on budget talks. \n\"We should not be leaving all the business of the U.S. government until the last minute,” he said. \nObama said the Ex-Im Bank \"creates tens of thousands of jobs across the country” and argued its lapsed charter hurts businesses large and small. \nThe $8 billion package signed by Obama extends infrastructure spending until Oct. 29, punting the debate until fall. Money for surface transportation projects was set to expire on Friday. \nRepublican leaders in the House and Senate are at odds over how to cover an estimated $16 billion shortfall in transportation funding, and Capitol Hill has been unable to solve the issue for a decade. \nThe Senate passed a six-year highway bill on Thursday, which was negotiated by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). \nBut House Republicans refused to take up that plan. House members left town Wednesday, forcing the Senate to pass the three-month bill. \nMcConnell on Thursday sought to downplay tensions over highway funding with the House. \n\"We all want the House to have the space to develop its own bill, because we all want to work out the best possible legislation for the American people in a conference later this year,\" McConnell said ahead of the vote. \n— This story was updated at 1:08 p.m. 1 day Fifth Planned Parenthood video...
