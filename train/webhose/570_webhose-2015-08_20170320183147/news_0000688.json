Reid was in the audience.\n\"We were doing a little reminiscing and then figuring out how we're going to deal with the crazies in terms of managing some problems. And then we talked about riding off into the sunset together,\" Obama said at the fundraiser, which was raised more than $300,000, according to the state Democratic party.\nObama praised Reid, crediting the top Senate Democrat as essential to the accomplishments of his presidency.\n\"It's hard for me to express how much I love Harry Reid,\" Obama said.\nWhile Obama touted the economic recovery, noting that the economy and housing market are \"stronger,\" the President also lamented politics for holding back further progress.\n\"The potential of America is so much greater than what is currently being realized and part of the reason is we have a political system that is holding us back,\" Obama said, before deploring congressional gridlock that has prevented passage of a long-term highway bill.\nObama also called on Congress not to block the Iran nuclear deal, drawing big applause from the crowd. Reid endorsed the Iran deal just last week, boosting the chances that Democrats can stave off opposition to the deal.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T15:07:59.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
