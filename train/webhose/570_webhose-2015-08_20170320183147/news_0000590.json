In the video above, Novak Djokovic complains to an umpire about the smell of weed wafting from the spectators during his seminal match Saturday against Jeremy Chardy at the Rogers Open in Toronto. \"Somebody's getting high,\" he says to a smiling umpire. \"No, honestly... The whole stadium smells.\" Djokovic later makes a toking gesture as if he were holding a joint. It was the second time during the tournament that the Serbian athlete complained of marijuana smoke , according to reports. According to The Telegraph, Djokovic also told the official, \" I am getting dizzy .\" \nThe top-ranked player later explained why the pot was not the kind of buzz he'd hoped would surround his play. \n\"You can't believe how bad it was,\" Djokovic said, per Fox Sports in Australia. \"Whoever it is, he's pretty high and I hope he doesn't come back tomorrow because it's a pretty bad smell. I didn't enjoy it much.\" \nDjokovic overcame the odoriferous distraction to beat Chardy in straight sets, but lost to Andy Murray in Sunday's final in three sets. \nAlso on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T17:51:32.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
