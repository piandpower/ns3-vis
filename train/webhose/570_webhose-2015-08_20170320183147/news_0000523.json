Scott Walker, a GOP presidential contender, called on Obama to cancel the upcoming state visit. ADVERTISEMENT Walker specifically cited Chinese cyberattacks against the United States, calling for \"some backbone from President Obama on U.S.-China relations.” \n“Rather than honoring Chinese President Xi Jinping with an official state visit next month, President Obama should focus on holding China accountable over its increasing attempts to undermine U.S. interests,” Walker said. \nTensions between the U.S. and China over cybersecurity have increased following a massive hack of the Office of Personnel Management this spring. \nOfficials have privately attributed the OPM hack to Beijing. The breach compromised the data of more than 21 million current and former personnel, contractors and others. \nBut Obama has yet to publicly place the blame on China for the attack, something that lawmakers, presidential hopefuls and others continue to pressure his office to do. \nDespite that reluctance, China’s approach to cybersecurity has been on the agenda for the meeting for months. \nSecretary of State John Kerry said that China's \"consistent\" cyberattacks on the United States are \"an issue that we recently raised very, very strongly in our dialogue with the Chinese.\" \n\"It’s on the agenda for the discussions between President Obama and President Xi when they meet in September,\" Kerry said in early August. \"We have agreed to begin to have a working group dig into this more directly because it is an enormous concern.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:39:52.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
