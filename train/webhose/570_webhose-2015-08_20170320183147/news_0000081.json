After leaving the military, she became active in the civil rights movement : She joined the Detroit chapter of the NAACP, and marched with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963. \n\"We are so grateful that she is here with us today,\" Obama told reporters after his July 17 meeting with Didlake. \"And it's a great reminder of not only the sacrifices that the greatest generation made on our behalf, but also the kind of trailblazing that our women veterans made , African-American veterans who helped to integrate our armed services,\" Obama said. \"We are very, very proud of them. That's why we got to make sure we do right by them.\" \nSome photos from the meeting: Pool via Getty Images Want more updates from Amanda?
