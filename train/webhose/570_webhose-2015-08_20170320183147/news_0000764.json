Bobby Jindal, who is also running for the Republican presidential nomination, directed the DHH to investigate Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which was seeking to open a New Orleans facility.\nIn her letter to Kliebert, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Melaney A. Linton, specifically addressed the fetal tissue issue.\n“Do any Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast facilities, or any affiliates, subsidiaries or associates thereof, sell or donate any unborn baby organs or body parts? Answer: No.” Linton wrote.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract Melissa Farrell, the Director of Research for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, is featured in the latest release by an anti-abortion group. (Center for Medical Progress)\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott called for an investigation into Planned Parenthood following the release of the first video on July 14, and the new video also drew immediate condemnation from the Republican.\n“The latest video showing Planned Parenthood’s treatment of unborn children in a Houston clinic is repulsive and unconscionable,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"Selling baby body parts is the furthest thing imaginable from providing women’s healthcare, and this organization’s repeated and systematic disrespect for human life is appalling. The State of Texas is aggressively investigating this matter and must use all available legal remedies to address this depraved conduct.”\nCMP has been the target of two restraining orders by federal judges banning them from releasing some of their recordings. The orders, however, have so far been limited to videos made at meetings of the National Abortion Federation and those dealing with a tissue procurement company, StemExpress.\nTuesday’s release, purely reliant on video taken inside a Planned Parenthood clinic, would not seem to violate either order.\nAt the end of the video, CMP investigators film a segment in what they say is the abortion clinic’s pathological laboratory. Farrell and two unidentified Planned Parenthood workers demonstrate the “quality” of fetal body parts, including intact arms, legs, lungs, intestines and eyeballs.\nThe CMP investigators ask to see any intact specimens, but one of the unidentified female workers begins laughing.\n“We had a really long day and they’re all mixed up together in a bag,” she says.\nThe “Just a Matter of Line Items” video is the fifth release from CMP. Like the first four, it contains undercover video of Planned Parenthood officials and associates.\nCMP has yet to release the full footage of its latest video. But a preliminary link for \"full footage\" exists on its website, and the organization has in the past typically released unedited video several hours after the edited video has been released\nThe videos have brought investigations of Planned Parenthood's policies on aborted fetuses by three Republican-led congressional committees and three states.\nThe Senate failed Monday evening to advance a Republican-led measure to halt federal aid to Planned Parenthood. The vote to bring debate on the bill was 53-46, shy of the 60 votes needed to move on.\nAdvertisement\nTrending in U.S. 1 Planned Parenthood official: Abortion procedures, prices altered to meet
