And liberals are \"morally bankrupt\" for supporting it. Andy Campbell Crime And Weird News Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 08/04/2015 08:25 AM EDT | Edited: 08/04/2015 09:14 AM EDT \nBill O'Reilly attacked \"morally bankrupt\" liberals Monday night for defending Planned Parenthood and \"abortion on demand.\" \nHe joined columnist Charles Krauthammer on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" but throttled the conversation, putting his own rant into the man's mouth. \n\"What Charles Krauthammer is telling the world tonight is that liberals are morally bankrupt,\" O'Reilly said. \"They don't believe in anything. They don't believe in helping the downtrodden. They don't believe in protecting the defenseless.\" \n\"No, that's what O'Reilly is says that Charles Krauthammer is saying,\" the columnist shot back. \nO'Reilly trudged on, labeling anyone who would allow “abortion on demand”as someone who doesn't care about the \"least defenseless in this world.” He called Planned Parenthood an \"abortion factory that sells the body parts of dead babies or fetuses.\" \nWatch the clip above to see the whole tirade. O'Reilly's conversation with Krauthammer begins at the 4:30 mark.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T04:09:42.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
