This. THIS is a sticker my son's public high school just forced all students to put in their science books: pic.twitter.com/MmVM1xu0Xf — Suzanne Young (@suzanne_young) August 19, 2015 Son got in the car, turned to me and handed me his biology book. \"You're going to want to read this,\" he said, pointing to the sticker — Suzanne Young (@suzanne_young) August 19, 2015 \nArizona law states : \"In view of the state's strong interest in promoting childbirth and adoption over elective abortion, no school district or charter school in this state may allow any presentation during instructional time or furnish any materials to pupils as part of any instruction that does not give preference, encouragement and support to childbirth and adoption as preferred options to elective abortion.\" \nYoung, however, said the label is inappropriate and misleading. I don't care what your religion is or if you think abstinence education works, that sticker crosses the line for public school. — Suzanne Young (@suzanne_young) August 19, 2015 I wonder how the girls felt about it in class. I would have refused. — Suzanne Young (@suzanne_young) August 19, 2015 It's SCIENCE! According to the majority religion in your area. — Suzanne Young (@suzanne_young) August 19, 2015 \n“The public school district has taken an educational text and used it to teach morality,” Young told BuzzFeed . “It assumes that all students have supportive parents to talk to and shuts down further discussion. It shames and isolates girls before supplying them with information and biological facts.” \nLast year, Gilbert Public Schools voted, with the backing of a conservative religious group, to edit the Campbell Biology: Concepts & Connections (Seventh Edition) ﻿textbook because it includes a chapter \"that discusses abstinence, birth-control methods , tubal ligations and vasectomies, and drugs that can induce abortion,\" according to The Arizona Republic. \nSuperintendent Dr. Christina M. Kishimoto defended both moves to Cosmopolitan. \nI worked closely with the Governing Board to provide a solution to last year's matter regarding the District's biology books. The board and I have full confidence in our teachers and because we trust the way our teachers instruct, we agreed that the stickers on the back cover are the best course of action. We are pleased with the collaboration and completion of this matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T18:44:50.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
