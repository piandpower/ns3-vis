Wilson - 08/09/15 05:00 AM EDT With just over a year left in his time in the White House, President Obama says he'll waste no time addressing issues he's passionate about. ADVERTISEMENT “I feel a great urgency to get as much done as possible,” he said in an interview with the host of NPR’s Morning Edition, Steve Inskeep, set to air on Tuesday. Inskeep asked whether addressing racial issues during his first four years in office would have been more difficult politically. “Well, yeah, see, that I don't buy,” Obama replied. “There's no doubt that, after over six and a half years on this job, I probably have an easier time juggling a lot of different issues, and it may be that my passions show a little bit more, just because I've been around this track, now, for a while.” Over the last few years, racial tensions have heightened significantly — fueled in part by police killings of unarmed black men and teenagers — and the Obama administration has begun to push for criminal justice reforms and opened up probes into the behavior of local police departments.
