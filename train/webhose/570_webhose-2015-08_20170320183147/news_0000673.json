For the last year and a half, she has spent her downtime as a clinic escort, helping patients at a nearby North Carolina abortion provider navigate their way past the protesters and into the building for services. For that, a group of extreme anti-abortion activists wants to get her fired from her job. As a new school year begins, they have escalated their efforts, harassing her school by phone and threatening to picket. Broder tells Cosmopolitan.com how her school has responded and why no threats will make her give up supporting a person's right to a legal, safe abortion procedure. \nI live in Wake Forest, North Carolina. I'm starting my 23rd year of teaching. I did one year in high school, the rest elementary school. I love the smaller children. They love school. They aren't jaded. They're so honest. They still love you as a teacher. I hug my children and kiss them on the tops of their heads every single day, walking in and walking out. You can expose them to things, like they've never heard classical music and then I play it for them. They don't know who Norah Jones is. Watching the light come into their face when they get it, like, \"Oh my god, I understand that. Oh, wow. That's awesome.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T17:16:16.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
