Judge William Orrick in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued the order against the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) at the request of the National Abortion Federation (NAF).

CMP released a series of videos in recent weeks showing an official from Planned Parenthood negotiating prices for selling fetal tissue Planned Parenthood is pulling out all the stops to preserve its federal funding in the face of public and lawmaker pressure.
