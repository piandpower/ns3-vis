A survey of 35 major city police departments across the U.S. found that 30% have attributed some violent crimes to synthetic marijuana use.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Tuesday, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton called it \"weaponized marijuana\" and described it as \"a great and growing concern.\"\n\"These dangerous products do not belong on store shelves within our neighborhoods and are a threat to public health,\" Bratton said in a statement to CNN.\nThe New York Police Department added that there are more than 100 overdose cases a month at New York's major trauma center, Bellevue Hospital.\nIn Washington, the Metropolitan Police Department said a man believed to be suffering the effects of synthetic marijuana carried out gruesome fatal stabbing on a Metro train in full view of subway riders on July 4. Toxicology tests haven't been made public in the case.\nAnd the city's EMS Department reports transporting 439 people suffering from suspected synthetic marijuana overdoses in June alone.\nMost of the synthetic marijuana comes from factories in China and is imported to the U.S., the Drug Enforcement Administration said.\nIn the wake of a crackdown in recent years, many convenience stores have pulled the items from their shelves and now users have to know code names to get it from store clerks or they can buy it from street dealers.\nAlong with hallucinogenic effects, the drugs can produce nausea, agitation, seizures and even suicidal or violent reactions.\nThe DEA says the drugs fall under a broad label of depressant-hallucinogens that it has had trouble classifying because of the varying types of chemicals manufacturers use.\nHomeless populations appear to be bearing the brunt of the overdoses in some cities. This week, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington plans to begin some presentations to homeless shelters to warn residents of the dangers of the drugs.\nThe drugs are illegal, but part of the problem in stopping it is the varying chemicals used to make them.\nThere has been some criticism that police are looking to blame the synthetic drug for spikes in crime, but Washington's police chief said this week said it was not the \"biggest problem, but it is a significant problem in many different communities.\"\n\"In some cities, synthetic cannabinoids is a huge issue, in other cities its just beginning to grow,\" said Washington's Metro Police Chief Cathy Lanier on Monday. \"Its connection to violence, that's a gap that can be fixed\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-08-05T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T14:29:44.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
