During a speech at American University in Washington, D.C., Obama will frame the decision before lawmakers as “as the most consequential foreign policy debate since the decision to go to war in Iraq,” the White House said in a statement. Obama will argue that the decision facing Congress “should not even be a close call.” The White House has made an all-out effort to sell Congress and the public on the Iran deal, which curbs Tehran’s nuclear program for at least a decade in exchange for sanctions relief. Obama has embarked on a personal lobbying push to persuade Democratic lawmakers to support the agreement ahead of the five-week August recess. The president needs the backing of enough Democrats to fight back GOP opposition. Republicans in Congress say they have enough votes to pass the resolution to disapprove of the deal, but the White House says it has enough Democratic support to uphold a veto. Ahead of Obama’s speech, the White House has compared it to a famous 1963 speech President John F. Kennedy delivered at the same school calling for diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet Union.
