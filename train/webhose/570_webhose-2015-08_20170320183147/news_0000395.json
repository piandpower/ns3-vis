Hide Caption 7 of 7 Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama and his family are spending Thursday at a beach in Martha's Vineyard with friends, including Caroline Kennedy and her family. The First Family has been in Martha's Vineyard since Aug. 7 and are nearing the end of their two-week vacation to the island off the coast of Massachusetts. Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, is the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy. The time at the beach with the Kennedys comes days after Obama spent the day with another member of a famous political family: Obama on Saturday teed off with former President Bill Clinton, husband to Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton.
