They're making common cause with the Republican caucus.\" \nFollowing his remarks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell demanded Obama retract the statement. McConnell, R-Ky., called the comments “bizarre and preposterous” in a statement released Wednesday afternoon, adding that “supporters and defenders” of the proposed deal should reject the president’s “offensive rhetoric.” \n“Members of both parties have serious and heartfelt concerns about the Iran deal,” he said in a statement. “These Democrats and Republicans deserved serious answers today, not some outrageous attempt to equate their search for answers with supporting chants of 'Death to America.'” \nSen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., also blasted the president for the remarks. \n\"I think it's beneath that office to be able to make these analogies,\" she told Fox News. \nThe president's remarks were part of an intense lobbying campaign by the White House ahead of Congress' vote next month to either approve or disapprove the international agreement. Opponents of the agreement have streamed to Capitol Hill to make their case, and have spent tens of millions of dollars on advertisements. \nThe White House is preparing for the likelihood that lawmakers will vote against the deal next month and is focusing its lobbying efforts on getting enough Democrats to sustain a presidential veto. Only one chamber of Congress is needed to sustain a veto and keep the deal in place. \nObama needs 146 Democrats in the House or 34 in the Senate to sustain a veto. As of Wednesday afternoon, 16 House Democrats and 11 senators had publicly declared their support for the deal. \nThe White House has said it is confident it can sustain a veto at least in the House. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
