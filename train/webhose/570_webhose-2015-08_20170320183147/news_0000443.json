Another container destined for the Netherlands had nearly 75 pounds of pot.\nNo arrests were made.\nJamaica is believed to be the Caribbean's largest producer and exporter of pot. Plants are grown mostly on the sides of mountains, swampy areas or hidden among other crops.\nDrug law amendments earlier this year partially decriminalized the possession of small amounts of pot in Jamaica. But authorities have not softened their stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal marijuana plots.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T03:28:23.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
