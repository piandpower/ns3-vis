Scott Walker (R) still isn't sure if Barack Obama is Christian. \n“I don’t know. I presume he is,” he said before a Saturday gathering of wealthy donors hosted by the Koch brothers. \n“You’re not going to get a different answer than I said before. As someone who is a believer myself, I don’t presume to know someone’s beliefs about whether they follow Christ or not unless I’ve actually talked with him,\" he added. \nWalker created a firestorm earlier this year when he said that he didn't know whether the president was Christian. He was also apparently unsure of whether Obama loves America . \nThe governor used a familiar refrain to answer the question, one often used by skeptics of Obama's birthplace early in his presidency. \n“He said he is, and I take him at his word,\" Walker said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T18:43:34.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
