Alright, you're going to make that?' Put the pressure on you, that type of deal.\" Curry played a round of golf with his father, Dell Curry, against Obama and NBA player Ray Allen, who is currently a free agent. Curry said that the President \"made fun\" of Allen. \"(He) said that (Allen) had a posse, that he needed a bus for all the people he brought to the course to meet the President,\" Curry said. Curry said that Obama and Allen won. 7 photos: Obama's summer vacation 2015 7 photos: Obama's summer vacation 2015 U.S. President Barack Obama plays golf with former President Bill Clinton, left, and former U.S. trade representative Ron Kirk at Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, on Saturday, August 15.
