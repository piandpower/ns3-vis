By the time officers arrived at the sex shop, Hucko was leaving the store \"with a large bulge in his pants,” according to Orland Park Patch. \nWhen an officer asked Hucko whether he was stealing or just happy to see a cop, the suspect allegedly confided “that he had a tattoo of a cherry on his penis and asked me if I wanted to see it,” according to the police report. \nThe officer then searched Hucko's body and found a pink \"G-Spot Delight Vibrator\" under his boxers. \nHucko told police he had no idea how the stolen sex toy got there. \nAfter Hucko was taken to a holding cell, he allegedly stripped naked and made derogatory comments about President Obama. Later, he signed the Miranda rights form with his new name. \nHucko was charged with retail theft, possession of cannabis and possession of drug paraphernalia, all misdemeanors. \nThis isn't Hucko's first arrest. In March, 2012, he was accused of stealing an electric scooter shopping cart from an area grocery store, according to Homewood-Flossmoor Patch. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T02:57:58.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
