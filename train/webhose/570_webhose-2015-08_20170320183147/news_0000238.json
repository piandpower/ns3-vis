The West Coast Career & Technical Academy student argues her school and the Clark County School District violated the Equal Access Act and the First Amendment.\nThe Las Vegas Review-Journal reports school officials waited months before telling Clark they denied the club because the topic was controversial, she said in a news release.\nAttorneys sent the district a letter demanding the club be approved, but have said they received no response. The lawsuit also names the district’s superintendent, the school’s principal and assistant principal.\nThe district told The Associated Press it doesn't comment on pending litigation. In May, a district spokeswoman said the proposed club didn't have a required faculty adviser.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://www.reviewjournal.com/education/student-sues-ccsd-banning-formation-anti-abortion-club"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T15:26:38.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
