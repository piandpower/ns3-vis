Once he was allowed back inside the room, about ten minutes later, he quizzed Trump and the two men debated for about five minutes. \nYes, it was a stunt -- but it was also a substantive moment of journalism. \nTrump, he said afterward, \"did not want to be specific on what he wanted to do with 11 million undocumented migrants.\" \nWhen Ramos woke up Wednesday morning, he tweeted that \"no human being is illegal\" and that \"journalists ask questions.\" Journalists ask questions/ Los periodistas hacen preguntas â€” JORGE RAMOS (@jorgeramosnews) August 26, 2015 \nRamos flew to Iowa expecting there would be fireworks -- but not expecting to be ejected from a press conference and told to \"go back to Univision.\" \nHe is often said to be the most famous Spanish-language news anchor in the United States. He had been trying to get an interview with Trump for months. \nSo he decided to travel to Iowa for Trump's Tuesday evening rally there. When he started questioning Trump, the candidate said \"you haven't been called\" on. But Ramos kept trying. \nRamos: 'I thought it was my ... right to ask a question \nThat's one of the things Ramos's fans like about him. He positions himself as an uncompromising advocate for his audience. \n\"After two or three questions I thought it was my turn and my right to ask a question,\" Ramos said afterward. \nAfter security \"pushed me out of the press conference,\" he said, \"I stayed outside the room, and after about maybe five to ten minutes, somebody from his team\" invited him back inside. \nThat's when the two men had a long, sometimes tense back-and-forth about Trump's deportation plans for undocumented aliens and his call for an end to birthright citizenship. \nRamos's point-of-view journalism is certainly polarizing -- hailed by some, criticized by others. \nUnsurprisingly, there were a wide variety of reactions to the press conference. Condemnations of Trump competed with headlines like this one from the conservative site National Review: \"Donald Trump Was Right to Kick Jorge Ramos Out Of His Press Conference.\" \nThe encounter ended with Trump saying, \"You and I, we'll talk.\" \nAfterward, a spokesman for Ramos said, \"We'd love for Mr. Trump to sit down for an in-depth interview with Jorge to talk about the specifics of his proposals. We think his thoughts on the topic of immigration are important to Jorge's viewers on Fusion and Univision.\" \nNotably, Trump did not tweet any shots at Ramos afterward.
