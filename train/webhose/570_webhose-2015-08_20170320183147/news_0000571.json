He also knocked Obama on Thursday for claiming the only option to avoid war with Iran is a deal.\n\"That's an absurd argument, and it's the one they've made from the very beginning, that it's either what the President negotiates with the Iranians or it's war,\" McConnell said. \"That's never been the alternative.\"\nBut Obama said the Republicans' unwillingness to consider any deal put them in league with Iranian factions opposed to the deal.\nWill Obama's attacks on Iran deal opponents hurt his cause?\n\"The reason that Mitch McConnell and the rest of the folks in his caucus who opposed this jumped out and opposed this before they even read it, before it was even posted, is reflective of a ideological commitment not to get a deal done,\" Obama said. \"In that sense they do have much more in common with the hardliners who are much more satisfied with the status quo.\"\nChuck Schumer to vote against Iran nuclear deal\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-08-09T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T04:51:08.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
