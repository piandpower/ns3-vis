In fact, our businesses have created 13 million new jobs over the past five and a half years,” Obama said in his weekly address. ADVERTISEMENT “Now, we need Congress to do its part to boost the economy, as well,” he added. “Unfortunately, Congress left town for five full weeks — and they left behind a stack of unfinished business.” He called for lawmakers to renew the Export-Import Bank, which helps finance the export of American goods. The bank had passed through Congress with no issue in previous years — but conservative members equate the independent agency with “corporate welfare.” Its charter lapsed July 1, and some in Congress has been attempting to attach it to must-pass legislation. When lawmakers left for their districts, though, the bank’s status was still in limbo. “When it returns from recess, reauthorizing the bank ought to be a top agenda for members of Congress,” Obama said. Obama also called upon lawmakers to craft a budget plan when they return. There are only a few legislative days left for them to do so – or the government could come to a screeching halt, as it did in 2014. “Congress also hasn’t passed a budget,” Obama said. “They’ve had all year to do this.” The White House opposes any budget legislation that continues the levels of spending that occurred during sequestration, calling them “senseless cuts to domestic and national security priorities.” “Remember, we can’t cut our way to prosperity. We should be investing in things that help our economy grow today and tomorrow, like education or infrastructure or scientific research,” Obama said. “Americans expect Congress to help keep our country strong and growing,” he continued. “When Congress gets back, they should prevent a shutdown, pass a responsible budget, and prove that this is a country that looks forward – a country that invests in our future, and keeps our economy growing for all Americans.” Republicans have rejected the possibility of a government-wide shutdown. The president touted his own achievements – including with working with states and municipalities around the country to implement paid sick days and family leave. Further, 34 states have increased funding for preschool education, he said – noting examples of working with Democratic and Republican mayors to expand access to preschools.
