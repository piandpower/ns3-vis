People who care about illegal immigration now have one candidate who is speaking out about it.\" \nMatthews added that he hopes Trump's \"over-the-top\" proposal to deport all undocumented immigrants will cause \"reasonable politicians\" to come up with more feasible solutions to the issue. \nBut contrary to Matthews' statement, Trump did not invent talking about immigration, PolitiFact notes . The issue has received substantial attention from politicians and the media for years, though recent legislative proposals to address the problem have been stymied by gridlock in Congress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:37:48.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
