On Monday, President Barack Obama will begin selling it to the public at a White House event.\nThe \"Clean Power Plan\" is the final version of regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency, which President Barack Obama called \"the biggest most important step we've ever taken to combat climate change,\" in a video released by the White House on social media Saturday night.\nUnder the plan, the administration will require states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards, based on their individual energy consumption. The plan also includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy and low-income energy efficiency.\n\"Power plants are the single biggest source of harmful carbon pollution that contributes to climate change,\" Obama said in the video. \"Until now, there have been no federal limits to the amount of carbon pollution plants dump in the air.\"\nJUST WATCHED Bush, Obama spar over climate change Replay More Videos ...

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged states not to comply with the plan in a letter to all 50 governors.\nCritics also said that the plan will bring unwelcome increases in electricity prices.\n\"This plan is all pain and no gain,\" said Luke Popovich, vice president of communications for the National Mining Association. \"That's why state leaders across the country are coming to the same conclusion -- that we should not sacrifice our power system to an unworkable plan built on a faulty interpretation of the law.\"\nIn a conference call with the press, Gina McCarthy, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said the plan would cost a total of $8.4 billion with total benefits expected to be $34 billion to $54 billion.\n\"Some special interest critics will tell you that it can't be done,\" McCarthy said on Sunday. \"They'll say we have to focus on the economy at the expense of the environment. They'll tell you EPA's plan will turn the lights off and send utility bills through the roof but they are wrong.\"\nA multi-million dollar campaign backed by the energy industry has sought to debunk the science of climate change, but polls show most Americans believe the planet is warming.\nCoal supplied 37% of U.S. electricity in 2012, compared to 30% from natural gas, 19% from nuclear power plants, 7% from hydropower sources such as dams and 5% from renewable sources such as wind and solar, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nEPA officials have conceded in the past that some of the dirtiest power plants now operating, such as older coal-fired plants, will end up shuttered as the nation shifts its reliance from traditional fossil fuel sources to cleaner alternatives.\nStuff from above 12 photos Ash and volcanic gases rise from the Mt. Raung volcano's caldera and drift northwest on the Indonesian island of Java. This image was captured by the Landsat 8 satellite on July 27. Mt. Raung erupted at least 13 times in the past 25 years, according to the Smithsonian Global Volcanism program. The most recent eruption has been going for about four weeks. Ash has forced authorities to temporarily cancel flights and close airports.

NOAA scientists predicted that the 2015 season for harmful algal blooms would be severe in western Lake Erie and possibly affect water safety. The blooms thrive when exposed to agricultural runoff, sunlight and warm temperatures. Hide Caption 2 of 12 Stuff from above 12 photos Smoke from fires near the shoreline of Russia's Lake Baikal was captured by NASA's Aqua satellite on July 27. The red spots show where fires were most active. Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake by volume in the world, but its water levels have dropped in recent months, according to the Reuters news agency. Hide Caption 3 of 12 Stuff from above 12 photos Alaska's Interagency Coordination Center said that 4,748,841 acres in the state had burned in wildfires by July 30. That acreage is enough to make 2015 fourth on the list of years with the most area burned. The record was set in 2004, when 6,590,140 acres burned. The town of Tanana was hardest-hit this year, with about 496,000 acres burned -- that's an area about half the size of Rhode Island. Many of Tanana's 300 residents left in June. The Landsat 8 satellite took this false-color image of the fire-scarred area on July 24, 2015. Burned forest appears brown and unburned forest is green.

This photo was taken by a crew member on the space station on June 6. It shows coastal lagoons with rounded islands along the Indian Ocean coastline of Western Australia. You can also see square, white ponds of the salt-extraction industry. This stretch of Australian coast has had more direct hits by cyclones than any other place on the Western Australia's coastline. Hide Caption 6 of 12 Stuff from above 12 photos A fire raging in California's San Bernardino National Forest had scorched thousands of acres by early July. NASA's Earth Observing-1 satellite took this false-color image of a burned area spanning 49 square miles (127 square kilometers) on July 3. The burned areas appear dark red because they're reflecting shortwave infrared light. Hide Caption 7 of 12 Stuff from above 12 photos Pilanesberg National Park in North West Province, South Africa, is located in one of the world's largest and best-preserved alkaline ring dike complexes. The circular features were created by an ancient volcano. This image was taken by NASA's Landsat 8 satellite on June 19. Most of the streams that run through the valleys have dried up, but man-made dams have trapped water for the park's wildlife. The structure sits about 300 to 1,600 feet (100 to 500 meters) above the surrounding landscape. Hide Caption 8 of 12 Stuff from above 12 photos Mt. Raung is seen spewing ash and volcanic gases in this image taken on July 12 by NASA's Aqua satellite.

Hide Caption 11 of 12 Stuff from above 12 photos Fires in western Canada sent thick smoke over Vancouver and adjacent areas of British Columbia in early July. Some residents wore face masks for protection and health officials warned Women's World Cup fans against outdoor activities. NASA's Terra satellite captured these images of the smoke July 5 and 6. The smoke almost obscures the Strait of Georgia and southern Vancouver Island. Hide Caption 12 of 12 The impending battle ahead could be seen as a major legacy issue for Obama as he transitions into the last quarter of his presidency.\n\"There are few issues more important to the president,\" a senior administration official said, adding that Obama is likely to make the case that climate change is a moral, economic and national security obligation in the months ahead.\nThe news of the President's plan was hailed on Sunday by Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley but was deeply criticized by Republican candidates.\n\"It will make the cost of electricity higher for millions of Americans,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said Sunday at the Freedom Partners Summit in California.\n\"If there's some billionaire somewhere who is a pro-environmental, cap-and-trade person, yeah, they can probably afford for their electric bill to go up a couple of hundred dollars,\" Rubio said. \"But if you're a single mom in Tampa, Florida, and your electric bill goes up by $30 a month, that is catastrophic.\"\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, also running for president, said on Sunday climate change \"will not be solved by grabbing power from states or slowly hollowing out our economy.\"\n\"The real challenge is how do we grow and prosper in order to foster more game-changing innovations and give us the resources we need to solve problems like this one,\" he said.\nExpecting a tough fight, the White House will launch an \"all-out climate push\" by the President and cabinet officials to fan out to sell the plan. In the coming weeks, Obama will travel to Nevada to speak at the National Clean Energy Summit and later become the first sitting President to go to the Alaskan Arctic.\nFollow @CNNpolitics",
