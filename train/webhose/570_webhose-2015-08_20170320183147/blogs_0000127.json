The order is aimed at extending the program past Obama’s tenure. ADVERTISEMENT “My hope is this continues to encourage a culture of public service among our innovators, and tech entrepreneurs, so that we can keep building a government that’s as modern, as innovative, and as engaging as our incredible tech sector is,” Obama said in a statement, encouraging others in the technology community to apply. \nThe program, initially set up by former U.S. chief technology officer Todd Park, recruits individuals from the tech community to serve a quick stint in the administration — six months to two years — before reentering the private sector. \nThe program operates as part of 18F, a government wing that offers technology help to different agencies. The fellowship is aimed at recruiting top talent from the private sector who might not be interested in a permanent job in public service. The administration recruits people for what it calls “tours of duty.” \nThe administration has touted the program’s success in opening up more government data to the public. \nThe White House on Monday also announced six new fellows. Previous fellows have come from Google, The New York Times and the Weather Underground weather service. Some of them have stayed on to take leading technology jobs around the administration.
