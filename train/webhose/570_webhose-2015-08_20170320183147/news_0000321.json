Obama was emphatic about how far he'd go to keep Iran from a nuclear weapon. \"As I have repeatedly emphasized, my Administration will take whatever means are necessary to achieve that goal, including military means,\" he wrote to Nadler. This goes for \"the life of the deal and beyond,\" the letter read. The President dedicated paragraphs to avowing the financial and strategic muscle his administration has put behind Israel's defense. In the tug-of-war for legislative sign-off on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- the name for the anti-nuke deal --- Nadler could be seen as the red mark in the middle of the rope. His congressional district covers much of Manhattan and a chunk of Brooklyn and has one of the country's largest Jewish constituencies. It also includes the area of the World Trade Center, the main site of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Yet despite tremendous pressure in the aftermath of 9/11 to go along with the Iraq war effort, Nadler voted against \"the Bush administration's crusade against Saddam Hussein,\" he wrote in his op-ed. \"I was the only Jewish member in the New York delegation to go against the president.\" Obama vs. Netanyahu 9 photos: What is the Iran deal, and can it pass through Congress? 9 photos: What is the Iran deal, and can it pass through Congress?

Hide Caption 9 of 9 The Obama administration is tugging hard at one end; on the other are Republicans and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has employed harsh rhetoric on the international stage and dispatched his government's emissaries to lobby against the deal. He visited Capitol Hill to give a speech against the deal in March, and this summer groups of U.S. legislators have gone to Israel to visit Netanyahu and hear his concerns directly. Though many objected to Netanyahu's public address to Congress blasting the deal -- and the White House saw it as a direct affront -- Nadler defended the Israeli government's participation in the Iran debate. \"I disagree with those who suggest that Israel's government or people must not interfere in seeking to shape American decisions on these issues, and I see such statements as a means of silencing an important part of the discussion,\" he wrote in his announcement Friday. \"Israel and Israelis have an absolutely legitimate right to be concerned, given the existential threat they face, and to articulate that concern openly within the American political debate.\" He also criticized the tenor of a debate which has seen those on the extremes accuse some Jewish supporters of the deal of betraying their faith and Israel and, on the other side, charges of treason and putting the interests of Israel before America by Jewish members of Congress who oppose the agreement.
