He added later, \"When I think about one horror, I also think about the possibilities that exist and I just don't want to think that somehow we discounted a human life ... Let's not compound the tragedy by taking yet another life.\" \nParaguay law allows abortion only “in very rare cases when it’s deemed necessary to save a woman’s life ,” ThinkProgress noted. \nHuckabee has taken a firm stance against abortion and suggested last month that he wouldn't rule out using federal troops to stop women from accessing the procedure. He also identifies with a small group of conservative legal scholars who believe the Constitution gives the president the power to outlaw abortion , despite the Supreme Court's many rulings on the matter. \n﻿ ﻿Also on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T19:09:46.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
