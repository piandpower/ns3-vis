ADVERTISEMENT “You have a consensus inside of Iran that they should have a right to enrich,” the president said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” “The non-proliferation treaty is very clear about guarding against the weaponization of nuclear power, but it does not speak to prohibitions on peaceful nuclear power.”\nObama contended that there is a lack of international unity on whether Iran should have access to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \n“We did not have the support of that position among our global allies who have been so critical in maintaining sanctions and applying the pressure that was necessary to get Iran to the table,” Obama said. \nThe president also described the notion that world powers like China and Russia would continue to enforce economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic as a “fantasy” and “demonstrably false.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T18:24:22.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
