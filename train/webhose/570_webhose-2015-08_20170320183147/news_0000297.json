Obama hit the links on Friday at Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs, Mass., with NBA star Stephen Curry, his father, Dell Curry, and sharpshooter Ray Allen. Playing golf with the president adds to an incredible year for the younger Curry, who led the Golden State Warriors to their first NBA title since 1975 and claimed the league’s award for most valuable player. \nBoth he and his father Dell, a retired NBA guard, built reputations as deadly three-point shooters. Allen is the all-time league leader in shots made from beyond the arc. In the midst of the NBA Finals this May, Obama wrote on Twitter , “No one can outshoot Curry — maybe [Atlanta Hawks player Kyle] Korver if wide open.” \nObama met privately with Curry at the White House in February after he attended an event on malaria prevention. \nFriday marked Obama’s fourth round of golf since arriving on Martha’s Vineyard for vacation last Friday evening. His foursome on Wednesday was also basketball themed; he played with Allen and former Miami Heat star Alonzo Mourning. The president is on a two-week vacation on the secluded Massachusetts island, where the first family has traveled almost every summer since he took office.He spent Thursday at the beach with his family. But it hasn’t been all rest and relaxation for Obama, who is reportedly making phone calls to members of Congress to discuss the Iran nuclear deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T22:07:15.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
