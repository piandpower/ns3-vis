ADVERTISEMENT White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that Obama will attempt to ease concerns that the deal, which curbs Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, could put Israel’s safety at risk. \nObama will make the case that the accord “isn’t just in the best interest of the United States, it is also within the national security interest of its biggest ally in the Middle East, Israel.” \nObama’s meeting comes on the same day Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a chief critic of the deal, will address American Jews via a webcast sponsored by two major U.S. Jewish groups. \nThe gathering is part of an aggressive White House effort to sell the deal, which is the most significant foreign policy initiative of Obama’s second term. \nWinning support for the deal — or tamping down opposition — among Jewish groups is critical. Many of the organizations have ties on Capitol Hill, where the administration is looking to halt an effort to vote down the deal. \nBoth the White House and Jewish groups opposed to the deal are targeting Democratic lawmakers, whom Obama needs in order to uphold a potential veto of a resolution to disapprove of the agreement. \nThe White House is also looking to boost public support for the deal, especially among Jewish Americans who overwhelmingly vote Democrat. \nVice President Biden defended the deal during a call with Jewish leaders late last month, soon after it was finalized. \nA trio of senior administration officials last week reportedly had a contentious meeting with leaders of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which is lobbying against the deal. \nObama and his allies argue the deal is the best way to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon while averting another war in the Middle East. \nBut many in the Jewish community and in Israel worry Tehran could use billions of dollars from sanctions relief to fund terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah and Hamas, which threaten Israel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T21:15:34.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
