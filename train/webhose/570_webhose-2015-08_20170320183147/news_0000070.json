The group says release of any audio or video would put providers in danger. \nIn his three-page order, Orrick said the federation would likely suffer irreparable injury absent a temporary restraining order. \nThe Center for Medical Progress has previously released videos showing Planned Parenthood leaders discussing the use of aborted fetuses for research.
