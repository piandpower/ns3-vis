ADVERTISEMENT U.S. District Judge William Orrick on Monday extended his emergency order against The Center for Medical Progress until an Aug. 27 hearing, according to The Associated Press , blocking the release of additional videos.\nOrrick sided with the National Abortion Federation's claims that it and members would face harassment, intimidation and violence if secretly recorded videos from its annual meetings were released, according to the AP. \nA lawyer representing The Center for Medical Progress said it would abide by Orrick's order, noting the materials barred from release in the ruling represented \"a small percentage\" of its overall collection. \nThe group has released four videos in recent weeks that have sparked outrage, leading to a Planned Parenthood defunding battle in Washington that is likely pushed to the fall after a procedural measure failed to pass in the Senate Monday.
